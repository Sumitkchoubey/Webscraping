Food was pretty good if a little limited over the course of 10 days. There are a few hotel bars, but it's not suited to those wanting a lively evening.
Whilst fairly remote from much of the island it's near to a few good beaches and hiring a car makes all of Kefalonia easy to reach - it's a relatively small but beautiful island. It's very relaxed with a fair number of attractions.", October 2019,

People come here year after year. The hotel has fantastic facilities which have now been extended used the wonderful spa, so relaxing and again staff very knowledgable about the treatments. The children area is safe clean & secluded with a great program for them even an outdoor cinema. The food is very good we loved breakfast fresh bread pastries fruit pancakes to full English all freshly prepared. My husband ordered an omelet & was cooked in record time & delicious there is a beautiful taverna also at the hotel very upmarket & great choice of food daily. The gym and beach facilities also great you can pay extra for surfing, boat trips, paddle boarding you will not be bored. Highly recommend for families & couples looking for 5 star grading with reasonable prices. Booked again for May 2021 with Jet2.", September 2019, Travelled with friends

Write a review",ameliasb23,"Worksop, United Kingdom",Jul 2020,40,50,Relaxing Holiday,"The hotel complex is beautiful with friendly and helpful staff. There are multiple pools which is brilliant to chose from. The area is stunning and the hotel is a short 5 minute walk to the shop and beach. Lost a star for the bar - the bar was table service but staff were run off there feet. Once you had finished your drink you would have to wait a long time before managing to catch the busy waitresses attention again instead of just waiting at the bar and reordering (the prices were a little steep too) but happy hour was the time to get your cocktails in!
We wish we had hired a car and explored the island! Beautiful. Catch the ferry across to the main town - look out for the loggerhead turtles!", August 2019, Travelled as a couple

Write a review",Dave, ,Nov 2019,50,50,Our sixth annual visit to The Apollonion.,"Our sixth visit was certainly not a disappointment. We eagerly awaited our visit this year with the extensive modifications to the hotel complex. The entire experience was superb, the food, the entire staff, even the porters are top notch. The new pool area, cocktail bar, dining area and New Italian Restaurant..The Trattoria are all superb. Pool and all walkways are cleaned daily, and we have never been able to fault the service around the hotel. The new buildings work well and the sensitive planting of shrubs and trees have been done thoughtfully and they tie into the original hotel perfectly. The morning breakfast and Evening meals are amazing with so much choice and the standard is very high. Compliments to The head Chef Vlassis and his team of chefs for providing such wonderful menus. Christos, the manager works very hard to see that all guests are pleased with all things, and his father works very hard too. Dimitris and his bar staff are superb, and the new poolside bar is perfectly located.Kefalonia is a special place for us , because of our fantastic connection to local people in and around Lixouri. The Kefalonions are pleasant, and easy to get on with and it adds to the entire experience. We will be back to The Apollonion and some of the negative comments really need to be ignored.", August 2019,

Write a review",RonLynda,"Darlington, United Kingdom",Oct 2019,40,50,Nearly got it right,"It was our first time to Kefalonia, but probably not the last. Such a beautiful unspoilt island without high rise and overly commercialisation. Stay date 19th September.
To get to the hotel from the airport requires either a long and winding road route or a pleasant ferry ride, we arrived mid day so could see the views from the ferry.
We booked a junior suite with private pool in the new Asteria section, 652. The views were very nice to the sea in the distance and the patio area quite large and private. Normally pools are cold, but to our surprise our pool was very pleasant and so was used most days. The furnishings as you would expect were in good condition due being only 20 weeks old, according to the TUI rep. The cleaning was good and our maid friendly.
Xi beach is a nice beach to walk along, with some stop off points for a drink. On two evenings we wandered down to Baywatch, quiet, chilled music and very reasonably priced drinks.
We didn’t see a problem with the heat of the food in the restaurant, however I would agree the variety was limited. Having stayed in many holiday hotels over many years I think it was acceptable but done to a restrictive budget for the chef. However service was really quite bad at times, not the fault of the staff, they worked very hard. But the drinks system is inefficient, one evening we ordered a bottle of water which took 15 minutes to arrive. But I watched as one man behind the bar took orders, made up drinks and the a bill produced, the backlog was apparently 15 minutes based on our experience. At peak times more staff needed.
The Maitre de was obviously stressed, which unfortunately he took out on the staff, to witness him scolding a 19 yr waitress several times when she was working so hard and doing a good, the result she started to cry. My wife went over to her and told her she was doing great. This isn’t good for staff morale, certainly not good for guests when in the middle of the restaurant. Maybe he has problems, so not judging except to say your staff shouldn’t be afraid of you, clearly they are.
We hired a car from Sixt, the Scottish lady was lovely, Catherine? This allowed us to explore the island, they were doing a 2+1 free deal, but gave the car back after two days. We would highly recommend Sixt and car hire, some fantastic scenery and beautiful beaches. We drove to many places and the ferry was very easy to use.
We went for a 45 minute de-stress massage each, which was wonderful. Stephanie did a wonderful job as did the other girl.
On our wedding anniversary we booked a table in the a la carte, the meal was pleasant but only three other tables in use, though our waiter said all tables were booked?
So overall a good hotel in a good position, but lacking in some areas. Staffing shortages are maybe due to not having sufficient local population? Everyone we spoke to was from Corfu or Crete or Greece mainland.
We enjoyed our stay and may return one day.", September 2019,

Write a review",KittyCan,"Durham, United Kingdom",Oct 2019,30,50,Beautiful hotel shame about the service,"On arriving at the apollonion hotel everything looked beautiful, large fabulous resort, although a lot of walking and steep banks to get to the pool and restaurant. My main problem was the restaurant, food was not hot, cold eggs bacon etc for breakfast, same problem for evening meals, after 3 days I complained at reception, the evening meal was warmer that night, but not hot. I complained to Tui rep on the 5 day, great, food was actually hot for the next few days. The restaurant is huge, service was really dreadful, the maitre’d showed us to a table once we were left to fend for ourselves after that, staff didn’t no what they were doing. It took over 20 mins for bottle of water and glass of wine, everyone was complaining. The only member of staff that seemed to be doing everything was Lysandros, ( I think his name was) he never stopped, very efficient, although didn’t seem very happy, not surprised really as he was carrying everyone else. Entertainment in the bar was dreadful, still had problems for a drink. The maitre’d eventually phoned on the day of our departure about our complaint, basically too little too late. We did have a lovely holiday shame about food and service, it spoilt the 5* rating of the hotel. Kefalonia is a beautiful island, it won’t stop us from going again just not to the apollonion.", September 2019,

We absolutely love the hotel and the staff make it so special every time.

Write a review",bpd1968,Oldham,Oct 2019,40,50,"Great Hotel, lovely place to enjoy a rest","Booked a sea view bungalow through TUI, but on arrival found that these bungalows were furthest away from the main hotel. We queried such with Guest Relations, as we'd asked to be near to the hotel, and were then allocated one quite near to the main hotel with brilliant views, downside we had to pay extra for such, but it was worth it.

Lovely modern room, good bathroom with large walk in shower and deck chairs on the patio to sit and enjoy the lovely sunsets. Room was kept very clean, sheets changed every day despite requesting not to. Main hotel area was very spacious and modern, lovely dining room with outside terrace and had very good staff, especially Gerassimos & Evangelia, who were always so friendly. Reception and Guest services were always helpful, again, lovely smiles from Vasiliki & Isabella. The food was always well cooked, good choices at different meals, but like others, why such small plates at breakfast!! Although bar drinks were reasonably priced the wine list was very expensive.

We had a good TUI rep Liz and booked the Premier Kefalonia trip through her, it was a great day. We also went into Argostoli which is nearby and caught the ferry to Lixouri tor a lunch trip.

Enjoyed a lovely rest, superb sun beds around the pool, great private beach with access to the sea and what a setting to enjoy drinks/food at the beach bar. Lack of entertainment didn't bother us, but could do with some background music at night, when enjoying a drink on the terraces.", September 2019,

Write a review",inspector77,"Leeds, United Kingdom",Oct 2019,40,50,Not quite there yet,"Have just got back from a ten night stay at the White Rocks. The hotel is situated a ten minute walk from Lassi. It is at the side of the main road from the airport. If you stay here you really do need to pay for a sea view or you will end up looking at the road. The Hotel is beautifully decorated and the rooms are nicely appointed. The food is very good. The staff helpful. The things that let it down is the lack of any atmosphere, the only entertainment is a Greek night which compared to a similar event at Zorbas Bar in Lassi is at best pathetic. In the rooms the bathrooms are very modern but using the shower is a bit tricky as there is nothing to hold on to whilst stepping over the bath sides. I am fit and able but as the clientele appeared elderly some must have really struggled.... The public beach in front of the hotel is very clean and well kept. The only issue is that to get from the beach to our room on floor three you will have to climb 123 steps. In the dining room the wine glasses were hopeless like little glass egg cups.

Write a review",Sunsets, ,Oct 2019,40,50,Sunsetromanticdestination,We have just returned from a lovely relaxing holiday at White Rock Hotel. The hotel is set in the most beautiful sea front location surrounded by trees and wonderful views. The food was really good a great selection for all tastes. The staff were very friendly and helpful and very efficient. We enjoyed time by the pool on very comfortable sun beds and also on the private beach which was peaceful and scenic. The lunch cabin was set in a lovely scenic area with lovely views of the sea. The selection of lunches was good too. Another great part of the holiday was the gorgeous sunsets that could be viewed from our balcony or from one of the terraces. Every sunset was different each one was very beautiful. The only thing that could have spoilt or holiday if we had let it was that we did not have rooms anywhere near our friends that we booked with in the same booking and no effort was made to rectify this. I think the hotel management need to be more aware that this important when friends and family book together. But as I said we did not let it spoil our holiday., September 2019, Travelled with friends

Write a review",Penybontduo,South Wales,Oct 2019,50,50,A Fantastic Holiday,"We stayed at this hotel for the last 2 weeks of September and had an amazing time. We were in a sea view room 407 and the views from the balcony were spectacular! The sunsets were different every evening and just so amazing! To be honest we had read the reviews before flying out and had just a few ‘niggling worries’ about what the White Rocks Hotel was going to be like, but on arrival late in the evening our cases were taken to our room and we were ushered in to the dining room to eat after a long journey! The only ‘blip’ was that although we had booked our holiday through TUI with our friends a request had not been passed to the hotel to be near each other and we couldn’t have been placed further apart in the hotel! It certainly did not spoil our stay - we used the Reception area as a meeting place! The room was so spacious with tea/coffee making facilities replenished each day. There is a small safe above the mini fridge - it took us a while to find it! We were half board and the food was delicious at every meal - all the staff were so helpful, but a special shout out has to go for Gerassimo for his attention to detail and making everyone feel special! There is a dress code for the men at the evening meal (women tend to dress up anyway), but to be honest I prefer to see the men in long trousers at dinner. Those holiday makers that didn’t like the rule had the option of just booking bed/breakfast and eating elsewhere in the evening. The area around the hotel is beautiful and unspoilt! We loved the private beach because of this and spent many happy hours there. During my stay I tripped in nearby Argostoli and had a small injury. The staff at the hotel couldn’t have been any more helpful or sympathetic! My treatment at the local hospital was very efficient and very quick too. Because of my injury we spent the last few days around the pool where I could have a dip too - the sun beds were so so comfortable. We hired a car for 3 days during our stay which enabled us to see a bit more of the beautiful, breathtaking island. We hired the car with the local company that we had been advised to and everything went to plan. We would like to have visited the museum and learn more about the history of the hotel, but when we inquired we were not told it was only open on a Tuesday morning and in the end we were too late to book it. All in all we had an amazing time and we certainly wish we were still there! Thank you to everyone at White Rocks for making our holiday so special!", September 2019,

Write a review",Carrieradiostar,"Farnham, United Kingdom",Oct 2019,50,50,Lovely hotel in Kefalonia,"This was my second visit to White Rocks and I am glad to say I had a lovely stay. If you want excellent service, peace and quiet and lovely views then this is the place to stay. Yes it is near the airport but I think watching the planes passing over to land is part of the hotel's charm. Its best feature is the excellent staff from reception to the restaurant to the beach bar to the cleaners. They are all polite attentive smiling and helpful and you feel welcomed and looked after. it is a good idea to bring a pair of beach shoes as the beach is rocky. The path to the beach is steep so care is needed. The food is very good and there is a lot of variety so plenty to suit all tastes. This is a really good hotel with excellent management and staff. 5 Gold stars from me.", September 2019,

Write a review",Claire,"Ashford, United Kingdom",Oct 2019,50,50,Fabulous,"A massive thank you to management and staff for a lovely stay. We stayed at the hotel for a week 13 - 20 September and it was superb in every way. The staff are exceptional and go out of their way to please. Outside the restaurant there is a display of memorabilia belonging to the owner of the hotel, Mrs Nelly who died a few years ago. The manager told me they conduct a talk and tour of this on a Tuesday but as we had missed this she very kindly arranged for us to see on our own. The lady who runs the hotel shop gathered all the items and put it all together and she is clearly very passionate about the history and future of the hotel. Her stories brought a tear to my eye - DO NOT MISS THIS OPPORTUNITY!
Hotel pool and public beach are excellent, just cannot fault this lovely place.
We stayed on bed and breakfast basis and walked into town each night trying different tavernas. We preferred to do this as there is a dress code in the hotel restaurant in the evenings and we wanted to be casual in our shorts. Without doubt Phaedra was our favourite and I would go back time and time again for their seafood.
Equally so, I would have no hesitation in returning to White Rocks.", September 2019,

Butlin's Minehead Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g190746-d282080-Reviews-or5-Butlin_s_Minehead_Resort-Minehead_Somerset_England.html#REVIEWS,"Warren Road, Minehead TA24 5SJ England",3.5,Very good,40,35,40,35,5,"6,426",,flutefairy,"Borough of Brentwood, United Kingdom",review Yesterday,50,50,Another wonderful holiday,"I have been visiting various Butlin’s resorts for 61 years now, I’ve always had a wonderful time. Despite visiting during the Covid 19 pandemic one thing has remained the same about a Butlins holiday, namely, there is plenty of fun to be had (rain or shine) at a fair price. I felt the measures taken to keep everyone safe from Covid 19 were good. Obviously, some changes have had to be made to comply with social distancing rules etc. and so a few things have had to be closed but there is still plenty to do.
We stayed in West Lakes chalet village, and, once again, we were delighted with the accommodation – clean, bright, modern, spacious and well furnished & equipped. Our chalet had a balcony (with patio furniture) directly overlooking a little lake complete with a family of ducks – all very peaceful and attractive. Where we were staying was very quiet (at all times) the beds were comfy, we all slept well. Free parking spaces are provided just outside the chalet which meant you didn’t have to carry your luggage very far. We chose to go self -catering (although I think you can add a meal plan to these chalets if you wish).
Not surprisingly, if one pays more for one’s accommodation it will be larger, better furnished and equipped. West Lakes chalets are lovely and, in my opinion, well worth the considerable extra cost. In the past we have also stayed in Gold Apartments which are also good but smaller. Although Standard & Silver rooms/apartments are smaller and less well equipped you can hire a number of useful items to raise the overall standard, e.g. microwaves, fridges, safes, fans, towels etc can all be obtained from the onsite hire shop. There are great differences between one standard of accommodation and the next, so it is worthwhile reading the brochure thoroughly so one knows exactly what to expect in order to avoid disappointment.
Included in the price of the holiday is free entry to a number of attractions including Splash Waterworld, the funfair and access to virtually all daytime and evening shows. If, like us, you happen to enjoy these types of activities then a Butlin’s holiday becomes quite economical if one considers what it would cost to visit similar attractions separately outside of the resort. Due to the pandemic one now needs to book most of these activities in advance via the Butlins website. It is probably wise to book these activities prior to arrival to ensure you have the opportunity to do what you wish.
We enjoyed our visits to Splash Waterworld, we stayed for a week and so were allowed to book four swimming slots, I believe weekend guests can book two slots. I felt this was fair in order to give all guests a chance to use the pool safely. Each swimming session was for 1 ½ hours which was a reasonable length of time in my opinion. The pool wasn’t crowded, this had the great advantage that one didn’t spend ages queueing for a master Blaster Ride or flume. The lazy river was also more enjoyable because it wasn’t over-crowded. The wave machine was the only thing not in operation presumably because it encourages crowding in one area of the pool, but all the rides seemed to be in working order. Currently, the spectator area is not in use. One is encouraged to come dressed ready for swimming and to have your after-swim shower back in your accommodation to leave more time for enjoying the pool. Lockers require a £1 coin to use which is returnable. Fewer guests also meant cleaner, uncrowded changing rooms. In many ways, using the booking system to limit numbers meant a more enjoyable time in the pool, this worked especially well for us as we had our 7 month old granddaughter with us which resulted in a much more peaceful first swimming experience for her.
The funfair has a small number of free rides which were enjoyable including Dodgems, Waltzer, Rockin-tug, Gallopers, Chairoplanes etc. On the week we were there queues were not too long despite the necessity of cleaning the rides between each group of riders, hand sanitiser was also available at every ride. There are also a number of side -shows with games that you can pay for separately. The fairground seemed safe and clean, as did the whole resort. The tiny-tots, indoor fairground was also operational, but we did not use this as our granddaughter isn’t old enough for such things yet.
The amusement arcades on-site were open – the one in the funfair was pretty empty so I felt safe entering it. I believe the arcade in the Skyline is busier but has a greater range of machines. The arcades need not cost a fortune, there is plenty of fun to be had on machines that only cost 2p or 10p a turn.

Butlin’s provides plenty of daytime and evening entertainment, free of charge, to suit different ages most of which needs to be booked in advance to manage numbers. However, we chose not to go to any indoor event as one of our party is at slightly higher risk for Covid 19 and so we cannot comment on how good the entertainment was. Butlins, has to comply with the same laws as the rest of the country with regard to closing times and what is permitted.
There are many sporting activities one can try at the resort but, in general, these need to be paid for separately, however, prices are fair. Not all activities need to be booked a long time in advance. We just turned up for crazy golf and were able to play straight away – although one needs to pay for this at the booking point in the skyline pavilion. Fun bikes were also available directly - these were paid for at the hire centre. We were also able to book bowling on the actual day we wished to play.
Butlin’s, Minehead is well situated for a number of other off -site attractions. Directly opposite the front entrance is a clean, wide, sandy beach. The tide goes out a long way and so it is probably worth looking up the tide times (which change by about an hour each day) on the internet if you want to ensure the water will be deep enough for paddling or swimming. Minehead itself is a pleasant little town, the historic harbour is interesting to visit and has some good pubs. About a ten - minute walk along the sea front from Butlins brings one to the West Somerset Steam Railway – this is currently closed due to the pandemic, however once it reopens a trip on this is always enjoyable, even if you are not a fan of steam trains it’s a very pretty route passing through countryside and by the coast. Dunster village and castle are only about 3 miles away, the castle was open when we visited in late September. Further afield, but in easy driving distance are Porlock, Exmoor, Lynton & Lynmouth and in the other direction Wookey Hole Caves and Cheddar Gorge.
Overall, we had another great holiday and hope to return next year.", September 2020,

This was the last place we would have ever thought of for a family holiday. Unfortunately with Covid and people being unable to travel abroad, UK breaks were booking up quickly and started getting more and more expensive. I googled lake or sea view accommodation and the Butlins chalets came up. We decided to take a gamble on it as it was very well priced and came in August for the first time with our two boys. The lakeside chalets are beautiful, super clean, and well stocked with everything you’d need for a self-catering holiday. Having to book shows and swimming actually works out in our favour as we know we can guarantee a table and there aren’t huge crowds and people all over each other. The staff is amazing and guest services cannot do enough for you.
We have just spent a week here again and had 4 days of the Just for Tots break and the atmosphere is so good. My 4 and 1 year olds absolutely love all of the shows and the red coats walking around making a fuss of them. They make the children feel so special just by commenting on their outfits or asking them little questions.
We’re so impressed with the quality of the accommodation and the shows on offer that we’ve just booked our third visit in couple of months’ time.

The room was very clean, shower was fine room was warm , was literally just the matter of sleeping.
I have no qualms about the cleanliness or how well they are running with covid hence I gave 3 stars I just generally do not get the fascination with butlins itself as a whole , especially as a holiday for some people for a week or 2. We hired a bike today just to go round the lake and see the caravan side , not even that looked inviting , everything looks so old and run down, to think they charge over £600 for the Seaview apartment is disgusting, it looks so run down from the outside, like something out of Beirut. The chalets towards the back look the best and fairly new but the rest looked awful from the outside, so outdated.
I think butlins is like a different style theme park, great for a day out but for me it's not a holiday, there's only so many times you can go on the same 5/6 rides or put a small fortune in the arcades. Some families had thousands of tickets but it cost a fortune to get them then when you go to collect a prize well that £2 tea cup at 500 tickets costing over £10 is mental, I gave my 900 tickets to some kid. Was all tac to chuck in the draw at home.
The drinks serving app, the function of the team as a whole I thought was great, I think I am just looking at the place as a whole. If it rains there aint much you can do except spend spend spend on machines or just drink.
Couldn't get a full breakfast in site, we had to go into town only to find everything shut so ended up in weatherspoons. The beach is nothing special and the town is very run down , depressing, uninviting , very backwards 80s looking.
I think as a whole you have to be a certain kind of person to enjoy butlins. Someone that dont like going abroad , dont like heat but wants to sit and do nothing but drink knowing they have a child or more over the age of 8 that they can just let them run wild with the same couple of rides, a little swim time and £20 a day arcade money and they feel like their having the best time being left alone to do what they want. Come home tell everyone you've had the most amazing holiday when in reality you've done nothing but spend a small fortune. I'm off to bed to get some much needed sleep.", October 2020, Travelled with family

However it has been a very pleasant surprise ! The whole site is running extremely well, with covid procedures in place. We have felt very safe and the place is extremely clean. There are a few things in place that are being done because of social distancing, such as the need to book swimming and shows. But my son booked up events via the Butlins app, before we arrived.

The accommodation was very clean and there is obviously under capacity to ensure every one has space.

We had booked the dining package and I'm pleased to report that the food is wonderful ! The social distancing did make getting into the dining hall a bit lengthy on the first meal,this is because the staff had to show us how the one way system worked. But every meal thereafter has been minimal queuing.

Every member of Staff is pleasant and attentive. The show squad is professional and entertaining.
It's good to see lots of Grandparents enjoying a break with their extended family.

Absolutely 10/10 Butlins for creating a smooth relaxing stay in these most difficult of times.", September 2020,

Another fantastic week! Took my 4 year old daughter who loved every minute! We stayed in a silver room, adequate for what’s needed for the week stay as we literally are never in the room other than to sleep.
Booked premium dining package, the food was nice with different choices each evening. There a one way walk system, food it plated up for you. Puddings are in individual plastic containers for you to help yourself, along with salad and fruit boxes. Drinks they pour for you to take back to your table. The only down side is you do have to que to get in. As everyone had to be shown to a table. Wasn’t too bad as long as wasn’t raining, but you could be stood there 20 min or more depending on the time you go.
Everyone one I saw was wearing face masks inside the pavilion and lots of sanitizer stations around the resort.
All the fair adults and children’s was up and running, took slightly longer than usual as they cleaned down the ride between every ride.
We were lucky to have shows booked up in advance, a couple we couldn’t pre book before our stay we did manage to book during our stay when people cancelled. But most nights there were tables empty so even if you didn’t book and show up and wait you should be fine to get a table.
My only gripe with the evening entertainment shows was you would watch the 7pm show then your asked to leave when finished at 8pm to then have to kinda hand around until they opened the doors at 9:30 again for the 10pm show. Which was really annoying when you just want to sit back and relax with a few drinks on an evening. I think it would be better if you had the option to just book Center stage or reds for the night rather than keep swapping and changing think this would make the evening flow a lot better.
For table service we used the b serve app, it was really nice and easy to use and quick service. Just make sure your at a table with a number.
Overall we had a great week, felt safe, the place was spotless. Can’t wait to come Butlin’s again next year! Best UK holiday for families.", September 2020, Travelled with family

We stayed in a gold apartment which was lovely and spacious (just wish we had paid extra for a patio😂) I managed to prebook 2 swimming sessions and a number of shows and they didn't disappoint the kids absolutely loved everything I booked. I was a bit disappointed that I wasn't able to book the Ariana Grande and Ed Sheeran show but managed to get a cancellation of the ABBA one (which I booked onto half an hour before it started). We all really enjoyed the arcades and fairground and it was very well organised with hand sanitisers on all the rides and the rides being cleaned after every go. Everyone was adhering to the rules - keeping their distance and wearing masks etc and I did see a number of staff who were enforcing this if it wasn't being followed.

The staff were utterly wonderful and could not have gone more out of their way to help us.

We were there during the recent Medicane cyclone and they did everything humanly possible to keep our stay at the expected level.

Practical things - walking distance to two beautiful beaches and three fantastic restaurants.

We had a very relaxing week, the hotel is in a quiet area., and 10minutes from the airport.
We met many guests that returned numerous times and intended booking again for 2021.
You definitely need a car to explore the island .
We had been to Kefalonia before staying in different areas but first time in Svoronata.
The hotel is kept very clean with the Covid rules . The breakfast is excellent and the staff are kept busy serving everyone from behind the socially distance screens. There is also a lovely bar & restaurant by the pool that stays open late into the evenings.
The Avithos beach is very nice with two restaurants and about a 15/20 minute walk from the hotel.

All the staff were very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. We stayed in a one bed room apartment, which was perfect for the four of us (kids aged 7 and 4). The resort never felt too busy, you could always get a sun lounger! And the pool was brilliant for our kids, at breakfast they were the first in and usually after a trip to the beach during the day the last out too! Our kids loved the kittens and tortoise, and making new friends around the pool. We loved the local beaches, snorkeling, and restaurants. We did the boat trip on queen bee which was fab, the sea is so warm and clear.
I would definitely recommend hiring a car as there are lots of lovely beaches to visit and it was too hot to try to get our kids to walk to the nearby beaches.
Avithos is only 10 mins from the airport, which again was fab as didn’t have to travel far with the kids.
With Covid I felt safer in Kefalonia than in the UK. The hotel and restaurant staff all wear masks and the only time spent inside is in your room. The sea food is amazing, the people are super friendly, the scenery is beautiful and tourism hasn’t spoilt the island. It’s a great place for a relaxing, quiet, family holiday.", August 2020, Travelled with family

The pool area was very good with plenty of sun loungers and the view was fantastic and down a few steps or the lift and you were on the lovely beach, it was not a private beach but it was never to busy and you had to pay for the loungers and the umbrellas but worth every euro. in the evening the hotel was quiet with entertainment on 3 nights a week. But 200 yards up the road there was a great Taverna called The Aqua Marina which was excellent great staff, great music and great food and the Kefalonian wine was to die for, it's a pity we couldn't bring more back.

The restaurant was good, we had read reviews about tables being quite close together and whilst this is true it didn’t bother us because the food is exceptional, quite possibly one of the best hotels for food we have stayed in, some traditional Greek dishes which were superb. Hotel is very near to the airport ( great for a quick transfer time) and so during the day there is some noise from airplanes but it didn’t bother us, night time was quiet. Some good local bars, one very near to the hotel made a nice change and we had happy hour as pre dinner drinks!

From check in, girls were polite and efficient we went to our room. Nice enough with a stunning view out over the sea. Beds were comfy, air con efficient, free safe, bath and shower good enough. Room towels and beach towels provided.

Found sun beds at the pool easy enough, only downside of the whole stay was it can be difficult to find shade around the pool. The main reason it was easy to find sun beds around the pool is the stunning beach the hotel is located on. Plenty of sun beds here as well and at €6 a pair plus sunshade an absolute steal.

The hotel restaurant was very good, plenty of variety all of excellent quality, big shout out to the maitre-de who was exceptional. There is the extra bonus of the beach front restaurant as well and the hotel allows you to transfer your meal allowance from the evening to lunch time in the beach one which gave us the opportunity to sample some of the local restaurants later in the day.

Not much going on entertainment wise but we make our own anyway and was not the reason we came away.

A break given recent world wide events we were really looking forward to. All went well until we were shown to our room a very small uninspiring affair,which bore no resemblance to the hotels own images of the room we had booked (superior side seaview).Obviously we were extremely disappointed in what we were now facing, to the point I was convinced we had been given the wrong room. So I double checked the images on the hotels own web site which confirmed my suspicions. When I spoke to the hotel reception manager (Marika) she immediately confirmed we were in the wrong room and that Secret Escapes had been informed the day prior to our arrival that there was no availability for the superior room we had booked and that we would be allocated a standard room. Obviously this was a complete suprise to us as we had received no notification of any changes to our booking. Due to the hotel claiming to be fully booked we were now left in a room that was inferior to our booking. We were offered a deluxe room which was vacant for 2 nights. We found this suggestion unacceptable due to packing/unpacking and still ending up in an inferior room for the remaining 5 night of our stay. We contacted Secret Escapes prior to unpacking to inform them of the situation and they denied any knowledge of receiving an email/ notification from the hotel. Which only added to our frustration as this meant one or the other was not being honest. We again spoke to the hotel reception manager who actually showed me the email which had been sent to Secret Escapes detailing the room unavailability. Marika did however manage to partially resolve the issue as a superior room would be available for the last 5 days of our stay and that a refund would be authorised for the first 2 nights in the wrong room. Whilst we were not entirely happy with the whole situation we were grateful for Marikas efforts and the lengths she went to in resolving this
issue. We have been in contact with Secret Escapes and provided a copy of the original email sent by the hotel to them. Having received an email from them informing us our complaint has been passed to the relevant
department for further investigation, we await further correspondence from Secret Escapes. To date we are still waiting on our refund and answers
from Secret escapes. I must say that
despite everything, all the staff at
the hotel were friendly and always
very helpful. The rating I have given is for the hotel not Secret Escapes.", September 2020, Travelled as a couple

The hotel offers a exceptional standard of cleanliness and safety, which under present circumstances is very reassuring. The hotel is simplistic in its decor, modern and has a boutique feel to it.
The room we like to stay in with a view of the waterfront, is ample for our requirements, with air conditioning and although slightly on the small side, there is adequate space for our needs, with comfortable beds, and a nice shower room. We do like the sea view with balcony, it is impeccably cleaned, We have found the dining experience to a high standard of cuisine, breakfast being a buffet style served to you, with a excellent choice, also a menu for cooked items. The evening menu offers once again, highly acceptable food, served to your table, outside or inside, and deserves compliments to the chef and staff. We think its one of the best places to eat in Argostoli. Most importantly the ambiance of the hotel is relaxed, and is run very well. Credit has to go to the staff from the restaurant, and most importantly the front reception desk, ably led by Marika, Vassilika and Anna Maria. Their assistance and friendliness, is so important and is an advantage to the hotel. For anyone thinking of going to the Kefalonia Grand, I would have no hesitation in saying it offers an excellent standard of comfort, cleanliness, high cuisine, for the monies paid. The position of the hotel is ideal for Argostoli, shopping and dining is close by and an ideal base for exploring the island. I think three visits in one season is testimony to the enjoyment of staying at this hotel. We are frequent travelers and were there during the typhoon and we really appreciated the staff, who worked under difficult circumstances.", September 2020,

On the face of it the hotel was fine on arrival and while we quite liked the industrial styling of it, like others we struggled with how loud every footstep and door slam was due to the hotel being entirely concrete and without any soft furnishings to muffle sound. The staff in the restaurant were great, but the management and reception were horrendous.

Our problems began when we realised we had been given the wrong room (a downgrade). Mistakes happen so we were sure things would be sorted out, especially as the hotel knew it was our honeymoon (got a complimentary bottle of wine on arrival).

However when we spoke to reception, we got a different story each time. First we were told no mistake had been made, and we had to use the hotel's own website and booking confirmation to prove that wasn't true. Then we were told it was the wrong room but they thought we had known and were OK with it (absolutely not the case). Then we were told it was the third party's (we booked through secret escapes) fault and they should fix it. Then when secret escapes reached out to arrange the refund but needed confirmation from the hotel by email they still didn't send the email. I saw the emails chasing and had someone from secret escapes on speaker phone to the hotel manager who swore she would send it right there and then. 2 days later she still hadn't so we asked again and again. The hotel manager then said that a refund couldn't be given until it was agreed with the 'Athens finance department'. Finally after a week of asking and being stressed with this, she sent the email (but trying to more than halve the amount we were entied to).  We felt we were repeatedly lied to, brushed off and treated incredibly badly.

I have no idea why the hotel manager would treat guests in this way and make it so hard to get a mistake rectified. The hotel manager also told us that 30 other guests were in the wrong rooms too and we weren't special. I have no doubt some of these guests never even knew. We're pretty trusting and easy going and wouldn't think to check we had been given the right room, only found out because our room was flooded during the hurricane and the hotel said they couldn't move us, and then it all came to light. The ones who did know (there were a few we heard complaining and getting the same brush offs as us) won't all have got refunds at all or for the right amount. The hotel manager was pretty smug about this point.

Thankfully secret escapes really came through for us and forced the hotel to give us the refund we were due (even to the last the hotel was trying to short change us and give us the wrong amount).

Believe the reviews that say they have been taken advantage of and duped by this hotel and avoid. It's just not worth it to stay somewhere that will treat its guests with such contempt.", September 2020, Travelled as a couple

The room had a wonderful balcony, view, but was dark , safe didn’t work, toilet seat broken, we kept walking into the concrete bed base, bathroom floor constantly wet, no shower door. No cupboards, draws, one rail everything else on the side or floor? contemporary!
Hard doors slam constantly, white painted floor looks dirty and marked. Slippers, towelling robes, nope,you have to request them,You have to request everything! nothing to do with COVID this is a money saving venture, no glasses in the room ,not even a bottle of water?It was near on 40 degrees! had to go to the supermarket to buy one,this is a four star hotel!

We loved it the last time which was five years ago so we decided to return. Not sure if it was a case of rose tinted spectacles the first time but we certainly won’t be back for a third visit.

THE GOOD

1 Beds are the best I’ve ever slept in.
2 Showers are best I’ve ever experienced.
3 The hotel is immaculate as are the gardens.
4 The swimming pool is superb as are the sun beds.
5 The White Bar and eating area are beautiful.
6 The rooms are immaculate and well cleaned with plenty of
storage.
7 The omelettes at breakfast were lovely.
8 The yoga class with Catrin was very good.

THE MEDIOCRE

1 Some of the waiting staff were very friendly, others less so.
2 Reception staff efficient but distant.
3 Breakfast on the whole was dull with cheap skate ingredients aside from the omelettes. Bad quality jam, lack of variety of breads, and the same everyday.
4 The entertainment made us retire to our room by 9.15 every night, except for the one evening when Hollis played.

THE BAD

1 We were charged €7 for a bottle of sparkling water!! Our questioning this extortionate price on our first night was met by contempt by the hotel manager who should not be in the hospitality business (she blanked us for the rest of the holiday). She told us that in a 5* hotel you should expect 5* prices. The dining experience at this hotel was far from 5*!
2 The food was average at best. Frozen vegetables, unflavoured poor quality meat, uncooked fish, the veggie options were often the best of a poor choice. The salads were ok, but the same every night. Food was like staff canteen, catering for the masses without love or flavour, not good in Greece!
3 As we were staying for the last part of the season, things deteriorated even more. The movies stopped working during a storm and they couldn’t be bothered to fix them. This left even less for us to do given the poor entertainment.
4. The coffee with breakfast was sub-standard; the orange juice was diluted from the beginning and somehow deteriorated into squash, being at the end of season.
5 SINGLE USE PLASTIC, coffee milk, butter, jam, honey, straws. Just shocking in this day and age!
6 We like to book TUI Sensimar primarily for the exercise classes. Sadly these were few and far between, again end of season apparently!
7 The lack of quiz nights, Greek nights and wine and cocktail tasting....it was like nobody could be bothered anymore.

All in all and comparing to the 4* hotel which we are currently staying in Budapest this hotel is a disappointment.", October 2019, Travelled as a couple

I’m not sure the 100% perfect holiday exists but this for us was as close as it gets. The fact that we are going to book again for next year sort of confirms this. We only book adult only hotels & have sampled loads. This place has great rooms, fantastic staff, decent food, great location and is well run. The Hotel sits on the edge of the resort and we walked into Scala a number of times to sample the local Tavernas. The walk isn’t too far at all and we tried a few places to eat but actually enjoyed the Hotel evening meal where you could control what you wanted (not too much on a plate so not over faced) and enough choice for us.
Evening entertainment a little limited but the twice weekly Hollis rock show was superb. We paid €5 for the CD and have nearly worn it out! (Wife just danced around kitchen to it while finishing up).
We don’t normally do half board as we like to eat out & have a wander. But after a 2 am start we decided to eat first night at hotel, & what a revaluation. You can eat when you want, & choose you’re own table by the pool or behind in little outside area, no queuing just chill and pick what you want to eat!

Food was lovely and varied, loved breakfast with freshly made omelettes. I would recommend the a la carts restaurant plus it makes a change to be waited on and the food was lovely. Pool area beautiful as it has got the infinity pool and the sun over it most of the day. Entertainment like most people said was samey, they were good but more variety was needed. I personally found the drinks a bit expensive but don’t get me wrong it didn’t stop us. Happy hour for cocktails between 5-7 but only had a choice of 5. A few nights we went into Skala town which was lovely, plenty of cocktail bars and tavernas. Wi if was ok around reception but not good in the rooms unless you paid for it, again didn’t bother us that much, just letting people know.

The rooms cannot be faulted - modern bathroom and the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in on holiday. The pool area was very relaxing and sun beds very comfy too! The restaurant area gives choice of indoor or outdoor dining which is lovely. The food is a satisfactory standard but can become a little samey after the first few days and the lack of fresh fruit (bananas, apples etc) did disappoint a little. Having read reviews before our holiday we thought the hotel may have addressed the food issues. The evening entertainment was very repetitive with a choice of only two singers - and I feel this actually put people off staying in the bar area after dinner. If the hotel can address the little complaints then this would have been a 10/10 hotel and holiday", September 2019, Travelled as a couple

Lovely clean rooms, pleasant communal areas, great staff, lovely quiet pool area.
Food is of good quality but desperately crying out for some spice or something I'm not sure what it is. Good selection but all just a bit bland. I've been to a few sensimar hotels now and the food has been better at all the others.
Bar prices average, lunches were gorgeous especially the chicken Caesar wrap, the best I've ever had.
Mega down point is the piped music and the evening entertainment. Having bought into the whole tui sensimar relaxation for couples thing I was pleased to be able to eat dinner outside with a beautiful view of the pool and lit palm trees, just lovely. But to then have 'sweet Caroline' blasted at me just ruined it. Then sophie the singer oh Lordy. Just not very good and far far too loud, singing disco songs to a smattering of 50+ couples wanting to relax and chat. Just wrong. We ended up back in our room, as many must have been as well as there was few people left in the bar. If tui have any influence over this as they are advertising relaxing couples holidays, they need to sort the loud piped music (some soft jazz or easy listening would be great) and the singer. No entertainment is better than bad entertainment.

Lovely hotel in a quiet location but like everywhere there are pros and cons. Please read in but equally these are just my thoughts which shouldn’t be bad enough to prevent anyone from visiting. It is worth it and sun rises to die for

A lovely contemporary hotel which is very well maintained.
Maid service is second to none. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a cleaner hotel
Food is good but tends to be fairly similar dishes most nights. That said..... there is plenty to choose from and tasty. Lots of salads as you would expect and all very fresh.
This is the first time for years we haven’t been all inclusive and a bit of a shock to the system at having to pay anywhere from 8 to 10+ euro for a cocktail.... small beer is 3 and large 5 euro. Bottle of water is 2 euro.
All staff are very friendly and helpful and the infinity pool is amazing. Very quiet by the pool which suits us. I assume that is because it’s end of season..... it’s bliss.
The bedroom is lovely. The beds are so comfortable and everything in the room you would need.
Complimentary Bottle of water in the mini bar for the first night..... a real shame this wasn’t replenished daily which we are used to.
There are tea and coffee making facilities. TV and the air con is great.
There are numerous warnings in the hotel literature that guide you to the things you CAN’T do which include.... don’t take the literature out of the room (why would you) Don’t eat or drink anything by the pool that you haven’t purchased from the hotel.... it illegal (their words) without an hotel receipt..... hmmmm
Anyway, there is a lovely bakery on the corner with cakes etc to die for..... you’ve got to try it and more cost effective than an 8 euro wrap from the hotel lunch selection.
Also local shop where a 2 litre bottle of water cost 50 cents..... (vs 2 euro for a smaller bottle from the hotel)", September 2019, Travelled as a couple

When we arrived our luggage was taken to our room by the staff and we were take to our room with a golf cart.

Despite our late arrival we were invited for dinner at 11:00 pm. A variety of food was already prepared on plates so the only thing we had to do was order our drinks.

The first morning at breakfast it was clear that there was plenty to choose from. Each day you had the opportunity to order omelets, unfortunately there never were pancakes available. Coffee and juices were available at the machines and could be refilled if you'd like to.

At noon you could enjoy lunch at the pool or at the restaurant at fair prices. Hamburgers, panini, sandwiches were some of the dishes you could order. If you'd like to eat something else you could go to the waves beach bar (5 min. walk) or go to Skala (25 min. walk).

Diner was not bad, but it seemed that there was less variety than we were used to in other hotels. But each day other dishes were prepared so overall we enjoyed the food. Especially the BBQ evening was really tasty. Of course when offering less variety means less waste of food which I can only encourage.

The room was very well cleaned and each day new towels were provided. Unfortunately at one day we were informed that the staff found out there was an issue with our warm water. Because the repair would last a day we were offered the Executive Suite since no other rooms were available. If you like more room and luxury you should definitely upgrade to this suite. A private swimming pool, two bathrooms (one with rain shower), a jacuzzi etc. are some of the extras you'll receive.

The swimming pool was clean and there were plenty of sunbeds available. It was not necessary to reserve sunbeds early in the morning. However there doesn't seem to be a policy concerning keeping a sunbed reserved for a long time while being absent.

If you're looking for a nice and quiet hotel near the sea I can really recommend this place. I would like to thank the staff for their hospitality and their kindness.", September 2019, Travelled as a couple

The location is excellent for Xi beach which is beautiful.
There was a good variety of food but I agree it could have been hotter - however the salads were lovely
Never had any problem getting sun beds around the pool but we preferred to spend time at the beach
Pool bar staff were very friendly and Anna on the upstairs bar was amazing
The rooms are a little tired looking but very clean - the cleaners are also very friendly
We hired a car for 2 days from Mercury car hire around the corner who were very helpful and also cheaper than the car hire place across from the hotel

The hotel is impressive to drive up to and the staff who warmly greet you at reception couldn’t do any more for you.
The same goes with all staff, our cleaner was amazing (on the second floor) left our room spotless and made our clothes into flower shapes and sheets into boat shapes 😊. She also left a jelly sweet for my daughter each day, she was such a pleasure to say hello to each morning.
The lady behind the pool bar in the afternoon and evening works extremely hard and does so with a smile, she learns quickly what you like.
There’s an entertainment team, one man organises activities during the day; aqua fit, pool volleyball, darts, ping pong and volleyball. He also does some quizzes in the evening, he’s fabulous.
There’s a mini disco on around 8.30, couldn’t understand half of the songs but we found ourselves singing along regardless, little ones love it.
Reference to the food, there are quite a few nationalities in the hotel and you can’t please everyone. I loved the salad bar, didn’t really try any of the main hot dishes on offer. But I’m fairly picky, I saw lots of other people enjoying the food. And the puddings are amazing, might have eaten my fair share.
There is a beach nearby but you have to pay for sun loungers and umbrellas.
There’s a local bus to take you to Luxori and you can get the ferry to Argostoli worth a visit.

By the agency (and looking at the photos) it was very nicely presented while the reality is much sadder.

The rooms:
- only 1 electricity socket by the bed and just on one side
- the beds are very very uncomfortable and there is no king bed but 2 single beds pushed together
- some closet doors dont open fully
- equiptment very outdated
- bird nest above room enterances so there is bird poop everywhere (they could make some shelfs above enterances and birds would have place to nest and you could walk normally)
- no key for the safe (you get it at the reception while you could be given one at arrival)
- no way to make shadow on the balcony

Staff:
- nice. They are the only reason I give this hotel score 2/5.

General:
- the pool only operates between 10am and 7pm so if you want to swim in the pool later, pick different hotel. The staff explained that they put Chlorine in the pool after that, like they couldn’t put it in 2 hours later
- you can only eat indoors, since the doors to outside are closed for no reason. You could eat breakfast outside but you won’t because.. who knows.

Food:
A big NO NO. Never ever have we eaten worse food. There is not much to choose from and from what you can choose from it is either overcooked (spageti, vegetables), totally tasteless (i won’t forget the “carrot soup” - you would have to try it to understand it) or dry (croissant, all the desserts, bread). All the ingredients are the low quality ones (disgusting sausages, 1 type of cheese and champignons from the can for breakfast and dinner).

The hotel should lower to 2-3 stars. Not worth the money.", July 2019, Travelled as a couple

Bar tender Manos and his younger brother Jason - serving the cocktail bar and beach - are the 'faces' of the hotel to the guests and one of the reasons so many people seem to return each year to the nine Muses is because of them.

Having had recent knee surgery and with a mobility issue, accessing the room was difficult as it was up a steep incline. I spoke with reception staff and when a more suitable room became available within a couple of days we were promptly moved to a very convenient ground floor room close to the pool and more importantly the bar. The hotel does have a 'Club Car' system to assist with the longer uphill walks. Unfortunately due to the COVID situation at least 50% of the local restaurants/tavernas were closed but we were able to take advantage of the excellent hotel Avra Restaurant, but again due to the situation the menu was limited but we still ate well.
Then the hurricane hit... Skala was not as badly affected as some parts of the island, but guests were advised to remain in their rooms. That being said the staff at the 9 Muses really 'stepped up'. During the infrequent lulls in the wind and rain staff contacted the guests, presenting lunchtime menus from the Evra poolside bar and later on dinner from the Avra restaurant. Orders were then delivered to your rooms. Other staff were working at breakfast time to assist the regular staff. After two days the situation improved markedly and within a very short period of time the hotel was returned to as near a pristine condition as was possible.
One possible criticism. The TV channel selection in the rooms was quite poor. Most guests felt this I think especially during the 'hurricane lockdown'. Given that the hotel seems exclusively for the 'Brits' it would not seem unreasonable for some UK channels to be available. After two days in the room I became an expert on Trump v Biden yawn !!. The hotel took the COVID situation seriously with masks worn by all staff and 'social distancing' being in force in the restaurants. This sensible approach was mirrored throughout the Skala resort in all shops, restaurants, bars and taxis.
Skala town is approximately a 10-minute walk from the hotel but there is a steep incline (Cardiac Hill) to negotiate. Easy option a taxi for 5 Euros.
Restaurants to consider: Paspalis, The Pines, The Old Village and The Siroco. There is also the Apostolis Taverna and The Brothers both of which were unfortunately closed. Well that's it...

From the moment we arrived, to the moment we left, you truly felt like you were on holiday.

The hotel itself is set out like a mini village with a variety of pools and bars, the main restaurant (with stunning sea views), a beautiful chapel and a short stroll from the beach. The facilities are excellent and all in very good working order. We also loved the addition of the cushions on the sun beds by the beach!

Our room was in the older part of the hotel, but they are very well maintained, clean, tidy and spacious. At the end of the day chilling on the beach or by the pool, well loved to come back to our room to sit on the balcony to take in its lovely sea and mountain views.

Breakfast in the Avra restaurant is always a delight. The set up is slightly different due to COVID restrictions, but the food was just as delicious with a variety of choice.

One of the things that makes this hotel so special is the staff. This is a family run business and their heart and soul has really gone into making everyone feel so welcome. The staff are friendly and helpful and nothing is ever to much for them. They also like to engage in conversations with you and make you feel like you are part of the 9 muses family. Special mention to Yuli at the top bar and Jordan (beach and bar).

Thank you so much for making our holiday perfect in every way.

We would highly recommend this hotel and we will be back.", September 2020, Travelled as a couple

We had been to Kefalonia many years ago and knew we should be safe. In my opinion these are the pros and cons
Pros
We had room 202 over looking the main pool. It was clean with a large comfy bed and plenty of pillows. Tea and coffee making facilities, small fridge and TV and safe. It had a great balcony with views out to sea and lovely quiet air conditioning.
The cats are onsite are looked after which as an animal lover is a relief.
The staff all worked hard in masks which must have been very claustrophobic. The breakfast was a good selection.
Everywhere was clean and well kept
The staff on request organised a lovely cake for my husbands birthday which was very appreciated.

Cons

Pay extra for the safe. In my opinion just I include it in the room.
We were woken on several nights at 2am by singing and shouting and music from the pool bar with people quite blatantly ignoring social distancing. Yes its inconsiderate tourists but having spoken to others who had rooms round the pool I suggest closing that bar at 12 and using the front bar instead.
There are many return guests who it became apparent where treated slightly different. Everyone is a paying customer

That said we want to thank everyone for just being able to get away and have a holiday in these difficult times and hope everyone stays safe and well", September 2020, Travelled as a couple

We paid for the premier rooms so were at the top of the hill in the new accomodation blocks, the views from our balcony were fantastic and the room itself was modern and spotless with a superb big walk in wet room.

The upper pool was fantastic to sunbathe around with even better views than our room. It was clean and refreshingly cool after the hot sun.

The main bar around the lower pool was manned almost exclusively by Manos, who was great to chat to while he served us, the beer was good and he makes a mean cocktail.

The staff and food at the restaurant were excellent for both breakfast and the evening meal that were included with our package. It only became slightly repetetive as we tried to eat local dishes rather than burgers or Italian food - that's not what we went to Greece for! Our main server was Marcello who was friendly, informative and professional as were his colleagues who we didn't catch the names of unfortunately.

The view from the balcony literally took my breath away when I first walked in – try to get a sea view if you can. The name is arguably a bit misleading as it’s really in the next village along from Sami, but being at that slight remove means it can be right on the beach, and it’s an easy 10-15 min walk along a lovely beach path (and past some good restaurants) to get to Sami itself.

They had us leave our luggage at the front desk and took us off to the lobby seating area where we were given a drink of Ouzo and were told about the area we were staying in. They instructed us as to nearby attractions, places to eat and how to get to Sami. By the time we were done our luggage had already been moved to our room. The room was clean and neat with a proper shower in the washroom and two beds as we'd instructed.

The hotel is a 10 minute walk along a proper walking path running parallel with the beach. The city has several shops and restaurants to visit and eat at. There are several Tavernas close to the hotel were you can order authentic Greek meals that were excellent. The Malissani Cave is only a 10 minute easy walk from the hotel as is Karavomilos Lake.

The beach is directly across the street from the hotel where there are beach loungers to relax on. If you don't like the beach or the sea there is an excellent pool to be used by the guests as well. I prefered the pool as the beach was very rocky and the water was shallow in the sea.

The breakfast buffet was fine for us with a selection of pastries, croissants, fresh bread, sliced bread, yoghurts, sliced peaches, cheese, ham, omletes, small sausages etc. Staff in the dining room were very efficient to ensure food was replenished and tables were cleared quickly.
Our room (204) was very comfortable with nice balcony, plenty of drawer space and plug sockets, glad I took extra coat hangers as the number in the wardrobe were limited. Bathroom fittings old but perfectly clean, shower over bath, hot water always available and we had sheets and towels changed every couple of days. We didn't pay for aircon, took our own small desk top fan (Wilko's) which worked well for us.
Pool area lovely and tranquil with plenty of sun loungers and personal space. Prices for drinks a bit high, paid 6 euros for two small bottles of cola but given the low cost of the holiday presume the costs have to be recouped by the hotel somehow.
We preferred to spend the day by the sea so walked down to the Karavomilos campsite and used the facilities there - 7 euros for two sunbeds, a sunshade and two bottles of water or alternatively you could use the pool and sunbeds for free if you ate in the bar.
An evening out in one of the many tavernas in Sami harbour is a wonderful experience, watching the ferries/super yachts berthing etc, nice then to return to the hotel bar as this had a great atmosphere for the last drink (or two). Typical costs are 3 euros for a large glass of wine or 4 euros for a large beer (both superbly chilled).
Definitely don't walk down the main road into town as this can be busy if a ferry is due/has arrived, turn right out of the hotel and first right again (past the dustbins) and follow the minor road all the way down to the sea front, it's a very flat 10/15 min walk past an array of friendly animals and locals. When you reach the sea turn right to head into town or the campsite beach is to the left along the promenade.
Transfers with Tui were very efficient, we travelled in a minibus and everyone was staying at the Pericles so no other stops, took 1hr 15mins on the outward trip but when returning to the airport it took just 45 mins as the driver took us a different route.
On arrival at the hotel don't critique it too much, give it a couple of days for the ambience to take hold and you'll appreciate what it has to offer. We had a great holiday and will definitely return to the Pericles for a relaxing break in the sunshine.", September 2019,

Went back to ask for another room, as the other was very overlooked, and we enjoy sitting on the balcony in the evenings, just couldn't do that in there room. At first the desk lady said she would have to have a word with her boss, so we went shopping and said we'd call in to see her later, when we arrived back, she said we could move to 217 which was on the side where you go down to the pool, so we were happy! She was very helpful, full credit to her, the staff at the desk were all helpful. The pools were towards the back, in lovely gardens, they were fantastic. The pool side bar did food during the day, and lady and the cook work very hard! Also, there is a tennis court, comfy sunbeds, umbrellas, tables and chairs. The walk to the harbour takes about 15-20 mins, don't turn left as this road is very busy and rather dangerous! as you come out of the car park, turn right, then right again it takes you through a quieter safer route. There are plenty of tavernas along the harbour front to.

Like boiled eggs and croissants! Overall the hotel is a little tired, but clean and staff are friendly

It does have its faults but it also has a personality of its own.
Let's get the faults out of the way. Showers are a major issue. They are small and the plastic curtain will stick to you whilst the bathroom floods. There is a solution and that is to leave the curtain open and hand hold the nozzle so it's spraying you and the wall. You'll probably soak the bathroom to begin with but better than getting the plastic curtain stuck to your bum.
Sure the place could do with a bit of TLC-so could most hotels. This is a 2* hotel and is basic.
Now for the bits that we liked.
Staff are really pleasant and helpful.They give everybody a warm welcome and if you learn a little Greek they really do smile and appreciate that you've made an effort.
The pool is a few yards away from the hotel and has a small snack bar which is open 10.00 to 6.00. No aqua aerobics or blaring music, just chilled. Plenty of sunbeds too.
The self service continental breakfast is good and didn't hear any complaints.Oh, if you want a brew in your room they'll give you a kettle.
You do pay extra for a safe and air con,there is also a room tax of €1.50 per night.
The rooms are comfortable and the bed gave me no problem although some have said that the mattress was hard.
We went in September so there were no school age children staying. I would say that at least 90% of guests are British and a lot of them are repeat guests. We are about to book again for next September.
As a holiday experience this was about as good as it can get for a cheap end of season getaway to the sun.
We ate out every day and the cost of dinner was between €8-€12 with 0.5 litre of wine $3-€4, A large draught beer was about the same. Plenty of harbour side restaurants to choose from.
The beaches are pebbly so recommend beach shoes. Sunbeds on the beach are €7.00 for 2 with an umbrella.
It's a 15 minute walk to the harbour, so ideal for all fitbit fanatics! But it's a flat walk and the lane way is quite pleasant.

It was AWFUL, and was more like an uncontrollable hose-pipe! The shower curtain basically stuck to you as the shower area was so small. If you did'nt use the curtain then the bathroom became a very wet 'wet-room'. Bathrooms are DESPERATELY in need of an upgrade! On the plus side the family room was very spacious - two large rooms with a patio area.
The owners were ok, not particularly that friendly apart from the bar man in the hotel and the staff in the pool bar. The pool area was a lovely and a big plus for the hotel, with plenty of seating and sunbeds. The mountainous views from here were gorgeous. The bar menu was basic needs to be alot more varied (and Greek) It was also a disappoinment that it only served until 6pm!! A scoop of ice-cream (in many flavours) was only 2 euros, so great for the kids!!

On a more positve note: My husband and I have visited lots of Greek Islands and we agreed that this was one of the prettiest! Sami is surrounded by lush green mountains and the landscape almost looks Italian with their native black fir trees! The views from the little port are gorgeous. You can also people watch and see how the other half live with some amazing yachts that moor up here! We did a Tui trip (discover kefalonia) this was well worth the money. We took in Fiskardo, myrtal beach, Agia Efimia and some caves along the way. We visited Ithaka on the Sami Star boat from the port. Wow! this was so gorgous and highly recommended. Will definately visit Kefalonia (sami) again, but maybe choose a hotel with better showers!!!

Just to mention.....mini fridges and air conditioning is at an extra cost (check small print for prices) Think we paid £200 extra for this on a 2 week holiday!

The pool area is gorgeous, a little walk away from the hotel to reveal 360 views of the surrounding mountains and countryside, so beautiful. There is a nice little bar serving drinks and hot snacks or lovely greek salad.
Breakfast is continental, a bit samey , and I feel that they could be a little more adventurous with the fruit selection, but its perfectly adequate. There is a dinner menu as well, although we always took the short 15/20 minutes walk down the back lane into Sami, there are so may resturaunts to choose from.
The Pericles is a great base to explore this side of he island, I would highly recommend Antisamos beach, a short drive/taxi ride, the beach is totally stunning, free sun beds and brollies, and a lovely restaurant for lunch, or they will deliver it to you on your sunbed of you like.

So much for my request for a sea view Mr Fawlty. Receiving little sympathy from the TUI rep I consoled myself that it could have been worse as we could have overlooked the car park.

Hotel Pericles is basic, and apart from the cigarette smelling corridor, very clean. Clearly the alleged newly installed smoke alarms aren’t working. Breakfast is adequate if a tad predictable and the rest of the food on offer is ok. The pool area is lovely however. Staff generally cheerful but provide limited assistance with the exception of Nico the bar man who serves with constant good humour and forbearance. Outside peak hours staff can be found working at the owners other restaurant at Antisamos- lovely beach well worth a visit but be generous to the hard working attendants.

Overall the hotel met our needs and provided value for money- so long as you had the coveted sea view!", September 2019, Travelled with family

We quickly arrived at the hotel Lassi for our 3 week stay and was upgraded to a studio which was quite sizeable and was told as we were there so long it meant we could do meals in the kitchen if we wanted. We was also given a discount on the safe as well. Our room was number 21 on the ground floor with a little corridor from it leading onto the pool. There was plenty of sun beds around the pool which got busier towards the afternoon. The room with a good veranda faced into the olive grove which the hotel seemed to have been built within. There was the main building with several smaller ones within the olive grove. I do think that there are a variety of rooms with different layouts and sizes, so I reckon we were lucky with ours.
The front of the hotel had a veranda with tables where you had your breakfast or a drink during the day looking over the view of the bay which was beautiful.
Breakfast was a mixture of continental or cooked food with a selection of fruit and pastries. Coffee was hot and a good brand.The staff were very pleasant and helpful at all times.
The hotel is based half way down the hill with two beaches at either side at the bottom, both had beach cafes there. We did find nicer beaches further on into Lassi with sandy beaches.
The resort of Lassi is basically one long street with lots of restaurants to choose from and you are spoilt for choice.
Back to the hotel we really enjoyed our stay there and definitely would recommend it.", September 2019,

As other reviewers have mentioned the reality is nothing like the photo edited website, this is not luxury boutique, it is a little shabby. We stayed for 2 weeks in the main block on the front with outstanding views and everything started off well. I think it was the first breakfast, when it dawned on us how substandard this hotel was. The breakfast is a hugely limited affair, with mediocre food. As another reviewer wrote there are only so many times you can eat scrambled eggs. If you wanted fried eggs, they charged 5 euro! Bizarrely, if you ordered hot food, fruit salad and muesli, it was all served at once, crammed on to a small table. They had no concept of how to make toast. It became quite a chore having to go out every day to eat a decent breakfast.
It was apparent how inept the staff were and how the place is run on a shoestring. There is no porter or handyman and the waiter runs the bar and reception in the evening. All the staff are very young and more interested in entertaining themselves than the guests. There are 3 reception areas -the reception itself, the front bar and the pool area, most of the day there is loud music playing in all 3 areas. If you like loud 80s music on repeat play this is the hotel for you. We saw people around the pool had headphones on because of the loud music. We couldn’t sit out on our balcony at times, because we could hear the loud music from the bar. I would hate to think what it is like in the new suites above reception. We asked the receptionist to turn down the music but she was completely uninterested and said “it was the style of the hotel”! This is not my idea of relaxing.
Don’t ask about COVID precautions, the waiters would come very close to you, not wearing masks.
Then there was the hurricane…the staff proved how incompetent they were. They provided no information whatsoever during this time. We found out by default they were serving breakfast – absolute chaos – people waiting for non-existent flights blocking breakfast tables and staff rushing around like headless chickens. The Greek authorities told us to keep to our rooms, as did TUI. Lots of rooms flooded and we had to appeal to TUI to get the hotel to sort the problem. The heroes in this were the 3 cleaners – they worked like soldiers clearing rooms of water, and at other times acted as porters and handymen. The front bar was wiped out by the hurricane (great no music for a whole 24 hours!). Because of the lack of staff, nothing was cleared away at nights and nothing done in preparation for the hurricane, therefore sunbed pads in the pool.
On the last morning, I asked the receptionist if she could prioritise our breakfast (room far too small for the hotel, queues again) and the waiter proceeded to have an embarrassing row with her in front of all the guests!
This hotel won’t change, you can see they don’t comment on reviews. I will return when someone else has taken over this hotel and can manage it better.
Absolutely loved Kefalonia itself, despite the most frightening thunderstorm ever the night before we left..more flooding…this beautiful island has so much to give and it’s people are so warm and friendly.", September 2020,

The only difference was we were hit with a cyclone many on the islands had never experienced before ...an 82 man said he had never seen anything like it in his life time.

Huge trees that had been there for centuries were pulled out of the ground, there was destruction everywhere

The hotel completely lost its beautiful symbolic tree - the one you see in many the pictures. This was not the only casualty but the fabulous bar area was completely destroyed

The team at the hotel had to deal with the torrential rain ...the likes I had never in my life time .. sorting out wet through guest at breakfast and throughout the day ....but the whole thing didn't phase them ..everyone was fed and watered and it is strange there was really sense of togetherness between staff and holidaymakers

The bar situation was absolutely incredible ...with 3 days it was back to looking even more fabulous ...gosh did the management and team work hard.

The island of Kefalonia is incredibly beautiful but if you are looking for a relaxing holiday with stunning views over the bay I would recommend the Thalassa.

On arrival we found because of the storm our Villa had no electricity as did a large part of the island.
We by chance managed to book into Astra Village Hotel for originally one night.
The lady in reception was delightful and we booked into a Premium guest bedroom.
The block with these rooms had recently been built, and the room exceeded our expectations.
The following day we returned in the evening and booked for another evening. ( still no electric at Villa )The same lady on reception could not of been more helpful.

Write a review",Andrew, ,Nov 2019,40,50,Relaxing hideaway,"We really enjoy the Greek isles and have visited Cyprus at least 10 times. Our ideal holiday is somewhere quiet and away from the crowds with an authentic feel. This was our first visit to this island and we were delighted with the Astra, we stayed for 10 nights.

The hotel is small and well laid out. All the staff were great. A good breakfast selection and a decent choice of bar snacks throughout the day. Although their is food available at night we visited the local restaurants which were really nice.

We don't spend much time in our rooms so whilst it was compact (small) it was perfectly adequate for our needs.

There is both a small supermarket in the hotel and a larger one directly opposite.

The beach is about 200m away and has beds, brollys and a bar.

The end of the runway can be seen from your lounger at the pool, don't let this put you off the planes didn't impact on us at all, given that there's only around 6 flights a day and when you are at the beach they literally are about 150 feet above you as they land.

The big bonus to being so close to the airport is the transfer time. From getting on the bus to getting off it took 6 minutes. I timed how long it took from getting picked up at the hotel to the airport - 4minutes, to sitting inside the departure lounge having gone through check in and security - 22minutes. 😁👍

Great little find perfect for those who just want to relax made even more special by the staff.", July 2019,

Write a review",Dodo70Dodo,"Bologna, Italy",Nov 2019,30,50,not a 4-star hotel,"Let’s start by saying this is not a 4-star hotel as I expect.
The public areas (reception, bar, restaurant, swimming-pool) have a nice layout and their facilities are enjoyable and comfortable.
The staff is polite and helpful.
Breakfast is okay with a wide variety of choice of savoury and sweet food.
The room needs improving a lot: we were upstairs in a junior-suite (4 people) facing the sea.
The room was tatty (old furniture) and we asked a couple of times for the replacement of stained linen (which they did immediately).
The bathroom as well was not adequate for a 4-star hotel (old equipment).", August 2019, Travelled with family

Write a review",Louise908,truro uk,Oct 2019,40,50,Relaxing 2weeks,"Facilities- lovely big pool area with plenty of sun beds, lovely views from pool area. Very clean pool and surroundings. Pool bar selling good quality drinks , food also available from there. Small shop on site. We stayed on a b&b basis. Breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice and very tasty. My only criticism is that the breakfast tables are not cleared away before 9am, so a few times I had to clear a table of other guests dishes. Pool towels available for 2 Euro per towel. Pool table. Entertainment 1 night a week. Spa ( didn’t use this).

Room- we had a lovely good sized room. Very clean on arrival and well maintained by the maid service. Kitchenette, kettle, fridge. Plenty of cupboard space. Small balcony with table and chairs ( we didn’t have a view). Good air conditioning. The mattress needs replacing though, it’s too hard.

Location- set in a small, quiet resort. 5 min walk to lovely beach. The beach has plenty sun beds, shallow sea, beach bar. Beautiful sunsets. The airport is nearby but it wasn’t a problem at all. There aren’t really early or late flights and none of the planes go directly over the hotel.
There are four really good restaurants in walking distance. You can also pay to eat in the hotel restaurant ( buffet or a la carte). Bus stop nearby. Large supermarket opposite hotel as well as the smaller hotel shop. We hired a car ( arranged through reception).
I would definitely recommend this hotel if you’re looking for a relaxing and quiet holiday. All the staff from reception to the bar and the ladies in the hotel shop were friendly, professional and very helpful. Would definitely go back and kefalonia is beautiful.", September 2019,

The whole area is stunning and very well done. A tad pricey but you can see they have gone to extra effort to make it a very special place.

Having spent 5 weeks this year at the Astra Village hotel I must say how much we loved our stay there. Its such a relaxing place to stay and set in lovely well cared for grounds. Our rooms were more than expected on our first stay,very spacious and comfortable , and I must say spotless with many thanks to the staff who do an amazing job and work very hard. Always a smile and will help you if needed. Breakfast was set by the pool with beautiful views to the sea, and was delicious ,you couldn't have wanted for more.

Write a review",Kath, ,Oct 2019,40,50,Perfect place to relax,"Just like all the other review I would have to agree this is the place for a very quiet break. The hotel itself was spotless, lovely staff , delicious food , stunning sunset views , nice sized pool and good size rooms. The beach is a 5 minute walk as are the 4 or so restaurants which were a great standard of food . Unfortunately because of the very small amount of places to est and drink ,the prices were quite high as there is no competition . This isnt the place for kids and defintely not the place for wild nights out but if you want to switch off and totally chill this is the place", October 2019, Travelled with friends

Write a review",David, ,Sep 2019,50,50,Excellent service and location,This was the second time at the Astra Village and again the location proved ideal - its relatively close to the capital. All the staff are very helpful and the food is good (though a little more variety might help). One thing that did impress was the effort made by our room cleaner to return it to pristine condition before our return in late afternoon. Highlt recommend, September 2019, 
San Giorgio,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g664630-d288581-Reviews-San_Giorgio-Skala_Cephalonia_Ionian_Islands.html#REVIEWS,"Porou Skalas, Skala 280 82 Greece",4.0,Very good,40,45,45,45,5,"1,524",,helen,"Phuket, Thailand",1 Oct,40,50,"Sleepy area of Kefalonia, perfect for relaxing",". The hotel was very quiet, in fact it was the last week of trading so everything was winding down but not so much that they didn't provide plenty of food and service for the few remaining guests. Aris the barman was especially chatty and helpful. Go armed with some good stories for him, he loves a good story! The only downside were the wasps! Take something to cover your drink with or you will be plagued, and some sting cream. You also need pool towels as none are provided. The pools are all super clean and COLD.
The rooms are set on a hillside with steps up. If you are at the top it can be quite a hike up. Having read the reviews of fantastic views (there are!), Unfortunately we requested a family room and got room 214 which had a view over the solar panels :( The beds were firm but very comfy. Aircon worked (if you close all the doors!!) . I took my own + t bags and asked for milk from the bar. The safe is chargeable - I suspect crime rates are very low anyway. The room service was optional at the moment. Minimal to full service.

The hotel bus goes into Skala a few times a day. You need to book a seat but worth the trip. We ate out a couple of times for variety. We got a taxi back - 6 euros.
Food - you needed to book a preferred slot for meals but it was so quiet it didn't really matter. I think this was just covid related. A mix of Greek, pasta, some potaoto (chips or wedges) and always Greek salads. Breakfast was the usual buffet food - plus fruit and yoghurt.", September 2020,

As someone who has a gluten-free diet, they always accommodated my needs. Food was good quality along with drinks.

Could not fault the team at the San Giorgio, they are so lovely, welcoming and accommodating, going the extra mile to make your stay perfect. Arrived home yesterday and have just booked our next trip to the San Giorgio (new swim up rooms) for 2021.

If you want English food, boozy loud karaoke nights, copious amounts of unhealthy snacks, bars/nightclubs & cafes on your doorstep and no animals then I suggest you head to Benidorm.

Our room was situated at the top, which at first provided the shock of about 7 flights of stairs but it was more than worth it for the beautiful sea view and sunrise every morning, and burnt off some calories!

The room was spotless and cleaned every morning, not that you spend much time in it anyway. Only grumble is that while you’re out of the room during the day not only does the air conditioning stop (understandable to save energy) but all the power does too which was a bit of a pain for trying to charge kindle/phone etc for short periods of time. No signal in rooms which we liked because it stops you sitting on your phone! Otherwise strong WiFi connection by the pool and reception area for keeping in touch with the world.

Restaurant staff cannot do enough for you, and the chef was fantastic - you tell them what you would like from the buffet and they dish up for you, so we found we wasted a lot less food and consciously ate healthier than at a usual all inclusive. We were pleasantly surprised to see mostly Greek food and not much English food, we do get sick of the holidays when British people go abroad then complain there’s no chicken nuggets or pizza and chips. Absolutely beautiful food! Slightly limited choice but due to current covid climate it’s to be expected. We did eat out a few times for a change of scenery but we certainly weren’t struggling for choice.

Pools are absolutely immaculate as are the surrounding facilities, you see the cleaners multiple times throughout the day and they work hard to keep everything clean and tidy. Plastic disposable cups are given during the day again due to covid, but this meant they could be quickly thrown away so no wasps gathering (the wasps were a slight pain at mealtimes). Poolside bar brilliant, particularly Aris who kept us entertained with his friendly jokey manner every day. Would have liked slightly more choice of soft drinks or at least one diet option (Diet Coke etc would have been nice).

There isn’t much going on after dinner, one night there was a guy playing piano and singing and it was fantastic to see people up dancing. Would have been nice to have some music playing even through a speaker in the evenings for a bit of atmosphere but otherwise can’t complain.

Overall would definitely recommend but would recommend hiring a car as Skala is a good 40 minute walk away (we did it the one day but not again!) and you can see the entire island by car in a day - which we did, seeing Assos, Myrtos beach, Antistamos beach, Fiscardo, Argostoli and Sami and it is an absolute must.", September 2020, Travelled as a couple

The hotel is beautiful however our room was very high up and there is no lift meaning we had to climb 7 flights of stairs everyday which was not ideal in the heat.

We went all inclusive and the food was very basic, we struggled to eat some days and most of our stay went out to eat, but given the current climate, we understand the hotel was uncertain if it would even open this year so this did not bother us too much.

The pools are spotless and cleaned everyday, lots of choice for sunbeds too. All staff were friendly and helpful and always smiling.

The pools and the hotel itself is great, nice and clean and easy to get sun beds around the pool.

The staff are AMAZING! they cannot do enough for you. I have a gluten allergy, and they remembered this every day and made me gluten free bread and pasta on request which tasted great. The food is yummy, yes some Greek food (which was lovely, definitely give it a try) but also some more English choices too. Particularly amazing service from the guy at the pool bar, he always remembered our drinks and was so friendly.

Yes there are COVID restrictions, but this doesn’t majorly effect the quality of the holiday in my opinion, after the year we’ve had we were so grateful to be able to get a holiday at such a great hotel. They are minor changes and if you’re going to be bothered by restrictions I would suggest you don’t go abroad.

We have read so many reviews complaining about the plastic glasses being used in the bar....lets think about it, i personally wouldn't want my grandchildren playing in the pool area with the risk of a piece of broken glass sticking in their foot!!! Plastic is the safest option, accidents do happen.
On the subject of cats, yes there are some cats at the hotel, you don't have to feed them, or take notice of them, but this is their home, we are the visitors, and they are not ferral, it's not as if they are going to jump on your plate and steal your food!! They just wander around hoping for the odd treat.
On the whole, combining the amazing views from every room, the cleanliness of the hotel and the friendly staff, we couldn't find anything to complain about, we just appreciated the chance to get away in these difficult times.

I’ve tried to do the review without being too critical of COVID arrangements which meant that some of the facilities were closed and in fairness it has improved a few things - the pools are a major plus and as great as ever and the spaciousness of sun beds was better and they have opened up the restaurant windows and tables were far less crammed together than in previous yrs.

The buffet arrangements where you choose a time slot and are served worked fine and the choices were largely similar to previous years. We generally were able to have some good Greek dishes most sittings.

The staff are working hard, particularly as there appears fewer of them in some areas and given that they had such short notice that the hotel was going to open for the season.

On occasions there were long queues for the pool bar especially as the lobby bar was shut and the hotel had reverted to the flimsy plastic glasses for all drinks, even drinks purchased, which is a shame and an old criticism.

Having spent a further 2 weeks in Skala itself I’m not sure why more of the facilities could not have been open but it’s probably due to the staffing shortages.

We had a great room below the pools which was spacious, kept clean and was faultless.

The shuttle service from the hotel was far more limited and although I understand reducing the capacity to 9 passengers I didn’t fully understand why it ran far more infrequently and finished earlier.

The hotel have built blocks of swim up rooms, now to be opened next year and I think the hotel will have to think about upping the ante in some areas to meet the expectations of the guests paying the rates for these rooms.", August 2020, Travelled with family

Dear friends,
2020 has been an exhausting year so far, and choosing not to open at all might have been the easiest thing to do, but Hotel Summery is run by our family since 1981, and we are aware of the impact keeping our doors closed would have had on our staff and our community. At the same time keeping you safe is a responsibility we take very seriously. We always cared a lot about cleanness and hygiene, but this season we are all the more committed to keeping every corner sanitised, and we hope our spacious grounds will make social distancing as effortless as possible.
Our staff has been trained to follow the health protocols determined by the Hellenic Chamber of Hotels in association with the Hellenic Public Health Organization, and we have signed a contract with a medical doctor, who is going to be available 24/7 in case there is a guest with COVID-19 associated symptoms. 
Wishing you all a much deserved summer rest, hope to see you soon!

Write a review",Jonathan,"Potters Bar, United Kingdom",Sep 2020,20,50,Needs money thrown at it !,"Our third year in Kefalonia - yes we love the island though Lixouri was for us not on a par with either Lassi or Skala. The pros of the hotel were 1) pleasant pool with beach just behind 2)Fairly modernised reception area 3) Decent enough breakfast 4) Lovely lady who worked the pool area 5) A helpful Jet2 representative. The cons 1) Abysmal first room with an extra bed and a tiny balcony which when I saw it I was ready to fly straight home - after spending a night in a second room which was ok we finally sorted out a third room and payment of a supplement for a sea view 2) On two subsequent nights a neighbour on each side got locked out on their terrace - it appears that the patio doors had dropped 3) Very questionable safety of the electrics in our room (matter to be taken further with Jet 2 as my partner got awful electric shock before the whole floor tripped) 4) Staff appeared to be put out as probably labelled us complainers and therefore rarely managed a smile for the rest of the holiday. In summary, I had some sympathy for the owners in particular with the current Covid crisis and reduced income. The bedrooms from the 3 rooms that I witnessed required complete refurbishment including an electrical overhaul. A rather huge input of Euros is required rather than sticking plasters on a gaping wound !", September 2020,

Write a review",Clare, ,Sep 2020,30,50,Lovely little hotel excellent staff,Just back from this hotel. We stayed for 10 days The hotel is very clean and even though the rooms are a little dated they are adequate for two adults. We had a first floor room overlooking the gardens near the pool and look to the right could see the sea. Breakfast was served to you due to COVID and there was enough choice for what you would expect The pool is lovely and very clean and really comfy sun beds. A 30 second walk from the pool and you are in the lovely calm sea where you could walk out quite a way and still only be waist height. Hotel staff excellent especially Alex (barman) Dina pool and dinner waitress and receptionists. There is a lovely square a few mins walk away lots of bars and restaurants and a great bar on the sea front cozy. Towards the end of our stay there was a hurricane and the hotel staff were excellent kept us all safe and informed and even put on a quiz night and ordered food in for us while we were all stuck inside for two days this was as-well as dealing with their own family emergencies due to the hurricane. To sum up nice hotel excellent staff and would return. I hope the hotel is now starting to recover from the hurricane damage 😢😢, September 2020, Travelled as a couple

Write a review",PingpongEastcote,"Eastcote, United Kingdom",Sep 2020,50,50,Lovely Hotel,"We were here for ten nights at the end of August for the first time. Had booked a sea view room and requested a 4th floor room. Our room was so small you didn't really have much room to move around, and as there were twin beds you had to crawl over one to get to the other. I asked for another room and was given another on the 3rd floor. It was better than the first room but still quite small. I ended up with several bruises on my shins where I kept banging my legs on the end of the bed. Ended up moving one of the chairs out on the balcony which helped

Staff were all lovely, especially Dina who works so hard round the pool and beach bringing drinks and food. Also the lady serving breakfast (so sorry forgot her name) who was lovely and also the barman who made us laugh.
Breakfast was lovely with enough choice and was nice eating under the covered outside area.
Pool area is great with plenty of sunbeds. Beach is ok but the sea was amazing! No stones or slopes when getting in and you can walk out for ages. The sea was so calm and no big waves. Perfect. Even a few little fish that you can see as the water is so so clear.
The owner is an artist and her lovely paintings are all over the hotel. I brought one of the prints to remind me of this beautiful island.
I would definitely recommend this hotel and cant wait to return", August 2020, Travelled as a couple

Write a review",Bob, ,Sep 2020,50,50,Perfect for couples and families,"We stayed in September 2020 (mid-covid). Firstly the bedroom. There are comments on here about bedroom size, well maybe the rooms vary but ours ( 2nd floor sea view) was of a good size with plenty of furniture and a nice (if a little dated) shower room. View was superb from a nice little balcony with 2 chairs. Inside was a very comfortable bed, hairdryer is provided and kettle can be loaned from the hotel. The bedroom also has air conditioning which was wonderful.
The hotel has a lift to all floors. The reception area is light and airy and so is the bar which also has a beautiful terrace leading to the pool area. Pool area is large and has loads of sunbeds both at the pool and also on the beach which has great views. The position of the hotel could really not be better. It is a minutes walk from the supermarket and 5 minutes walk from the start of the shops, bars and restaurants, it is also on a quiet road. Breakfast (during covid) was buffet but served from behind screens. The breakfast was fine, many choices from fruit, hams, cheese, cereal etc to sausages and scrambled eggs. Lixouri itself was a nice small town with lots of bars and restaurants and a scattering of shops selling clothes and souvenirs. Without dawdling you could see it all in an hour. Nearby are several good beaches including Petani, Xi and my favorite little beach Lipade, all would need a car/taxi. There is a very good car hire place close to the hotel called Porto car hire, we had a little jeep for 5 days for about 180 euros and it was well worth it as we visited places further afield as well. The best thing about the hotel was the staff/owners. Big shout here to Alex the barman/stand up comedian, Angie and Marie at reception Eliza who served breakfasts and all the happy, smiley cleaning staff. This is an ideal holiday hotel for people wanting a quiet, relaxing holiday in a beautiful setting. Remember, it is a 2 star ( or 3 depending upon where you look) hotel, its not The Dorchester but we will be returning next September and many of our fellow guests during our stay were on their 3rd or even 4th visit which probably says more than all my words.", September 2020,

Write a review",david,"Oldham, United Kingdom",Aug 2020,50,50,Just dad and lad on a post uni break,"Strange hotel in many ways. It's a 2star hotel, and purely on the room and shower unit, its below standard.
The public areas are clean and bright and nice, eat in or out breakfast area, not self service because of covid, you have to like it continental or you would be disappointed, but it's a greek island.....greek yogurt and honey was great, as was the coffee.. I'd go back and get more.
Pool is ok, not massive or shaped, but in a lovely garden spot, cant say what it would be like if the hotel was busy, but it is the covid summer. Masks mandatory in the hotel, and rightly so, very clean as well.
Getting back to the pool area, waiter service all the time, and the lady also cleaned the beds ect when not in use. Sunbeds are high quality as are the seating areas. This area leads directly on to a beach, this also has sun loungers and waiter service. The beach isn't as bad as I thought it maybe, having looked at the reviews, it was nice to see the sea from the pool area. So I'd say the hotel public indoor areas, and the pool area are far superior to the rating, boutique standard would be my assessment.
Given all this it gets top marks from me as it is lovely (outside of the rooms), and better than its rating.", August 2020, Travelled with family

Write a review",6Emms6,"Horsforth, United Kingdom",Aug 2020,50,50,Cute little hotel,"Andy’s review further below pretty much sums everything up perfectly. I was also super worried about travelling and getting tested but it was all fine. We saw a few people from our flight selected as passport control to have a covid test. We weren’t tested so continued to our hotel via a bus (15-20 mins?), ferry (25 mins) and a taxi which took literally 1 minute as hotel summery is a few minutes walk from the ferry, Lixouri town square and the sea front restaurants and bars. Everything was open and had a nice atmosphere in the evenings, not too busy which meant we could always get a table. Lots of choice for places to eat and drink. Our favourite was spavento, we ate there everyday for lunch!

Hotel summery was a great choice for us. It’s rustic and a bit dated but good value. The staff are nice and friendly. We booked a week before coming so we didn’t get a choice of a sea front room but that was fine. The rooms are in need of updating. The breakfast was continental which we enjoyed. There is pool/beach service all day for drinks. The pool is nice, not too big. Sun loungers are plentiful. The beachfront location is lovely, the beach could do with a rake but the sea is so calm and clear it makes up for it. Lovely mountain views.

Write a review",pmsufc,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",Aug 2020,40,50,Lovely People,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Summery, the staff are excellent, ever smiling Eliza and Dina, the gorgeous Angie (miss seeing you on the beach), Marina and Alex helping us with some understanding of Greece and Kefalonia, everyone was great.
The pool area and beach were quite picturesque and kept within Covid restrictions.
Breakfast had quite a decent selection but do not expect a full English, after all you are in Greece but there is sufficient choice to get a good breakfast. The lunches are good too.
However there is a downside, the rooms, I know its only 2/3 star but they are in need of updating and improving, i understand too that it will be difficult with the current situation regarding under occupancy, short season and finances so it will probably not get done this winter. In our room the faults were relatively minor, shower head sprayed everywhere, the towel hook on the bathroom door fell off, the wardrobe and cupboards were from the ark. Overall though I have given 4 out of 5 and may return in a couple of years.", July 2020,

A very large part of the village was destroyed and most people lost all their belongings. The villa we were staying in was flooded. The room my daughter, partner and baby were staying in had water blasting in through the roof and windows - it was absolutely terrifying, the baby was crying and extremely distraught. (To give an idea of how bad it got in the area - two friends, who were staying lower down in the village, made their escape when the water in their villa got to chest level and had to swim through the window they then had to climb a 6ft wall - fortunately they survived. - A very kind lady saw them. and took them in.) As a result we were all without water and electricity for a number of days. The only hotel that had power and water was The Odyssey as they have their own generator. I booked a room for my daughter, & family. When the receptionist realised there was a baby she said she wouldn’t allow them to stay as it would upset their regular clients as the hotel has a ‘no- child’ policy. Surely, under the circumstances, the regular clients would have understood why the baby was there for a couple of nights and showed a little compassion - unlike the receptionist (who claimed to own the hotel.) She was quite happy to allow myself and family to have lunch in the restaurant. Maybe one day when she has grandchildren of her own or in a desperate situation, someone will show her some compassion - I do hope so - hopefully it may teach her a good/necessary lesson. Shame on you.", September 2020, Travelled with family

Catherine, Gerry, Aristos, Vangelis and all the team at the Odyssey go out of their way to make sure you enjoy every minute of your well earned rest. They are professional and attentive 100% of the time, even though they have to wear protective masks in very hot weather - there is always a smile and nothing is too much trouble.

The hotel is COVID safe, spotlessly clean as always and attention to social distancing is maintained, whilst allowing you to relax and enjoy your holiday.

The menu is always extensive, but this year had some great additions - the food really is first class.

Agia Effimia is the best location on the island, with great shops and tavernas, and a really relaxed feel to it. You can get to all other areas easily and the north of the island is by far the most beautiful with stunning scenery and beaches.

We cannot imagine a year without visiting the Odyssey and we are counting down the days until our 2021 return.

Thank you to all the amazing team for another great holiday, especially in incredibly challenging circumstances.

Take care and see you next year.....!", August 2020,

First of all the location... Just wow. Small basic tradional bed and breakfast 30 seconds from a small beach with crystal clear water.
Hotel is spotless clean and a credit to all staff who work there.
Makis the owner is 1 in a million. He goes above and beyond to make your holiday special, he can arrange anything you need, just ask him and it's done. Astrid is very speacial too, she works the bar, helps with breakfast, helps guests with anything they need.
Cleaners are all very happy and polite and do an amazing job.
The hotel next door has a beautiful pool with a bar and food which you can use.
Very quiet, relaxing location with beautiful views.
We hired a car and toured part of the island at our own leisure. I definitely recommend to do this. The owner Makis can arrange this for you.

This is the best holiday I've had and we are going back next year.
There are a couple of nice tavernas 50yrds away, or you can go to sami where there are lots of eateries only 15 min walk away.
Thank you to Makis, Astrid and the team for making our holiday so speacial.
If your looking for night life and party location it's not for you. It's very quiet. Average age of guests is 50 but some younger couples there too. Most guests return year after year

All 3 pools were stunning, similar to a tropical Bali villa. We never had a problem getting a lounger at any of the pools and often had one to ourselves. Pool and beach service was great and at a very relaxed speed. I fused water is provided for free throughout the resort so you always have access to something cold and refreshing.

The gym and fitness classes looked great and were plentiful, although I wasn’t there for that this time. I did use the outdoor gym, which I had to myself each time. Drinks, fresh towels and control over the music was all available.

The outdoor cinema was awesome, such a nice touch and worth a visit. You also have free water sports available from the beach.

Food was great, everything incredibly healthy but tasty! They offered both Wellness and Alcohol drinks, so tailored for whichever relaxing stay you are looking for.

We were looking for a break that also ticks our health and fitness wants when we stumbled across this place by mistake and thank god we did!
From the moment we arrived we knew we had chosen well, a stunning location with uninterrupted views across the ocean from all vantage points, a seamless, friendly check-in and a beautifully appointed, spacious bedroom. We're both pretty well travelled and would rate this in our top 3 hotels ever.
FOOD - Breakfast is an la carte and also buffet menu. There are 2 restaurants at the hotel, both of which offer a good variety of dishes for lunch and allow you to be as healthy (or not!) as you like. There's a 'wellness drinks' and a normal drinks menu too. Dinner is beautiful with amazing sunset views over the sea, very romantic but also a great vibey atmosphere. If you fancy a change there are 4/5 good little tavernas on the beach too.
SERVICE - The team do this place so proud. They really do make the experience for guests and I wish i could take them all with me for our hospitality interests! If I knew everyones names I would mention them all as they're all great, but in particular Vassia, illias, Niko and Adonis looked after us so well. They know what you want before you do!!
SPA - The best spa treatments either of us have ever had. Say no more.
CLASSES - There's lots of variety to choose from, 2 yoga decks, 2 gyms fully kitted out with all the equipment you could ever need. Classes run daily and you can pick and choose what you do, from hiking to yoga to functional fitness classes. There's also a cool outdoor cinema showing a different film every night which is a great touch.

However, only criticism - we booked this hotel specifically because it was advertised on its website as an adults only retreat and this wasn’t the case. Towards the end of our stay there was a family there with two young teenage boys - we asked about this at reception and were told they were staying in a villa on site and not in the hotel, however they were using all the hotel facilities (the restaurant, the pools) so not sure what the difference was? Then on our last day we noticed another family with a child check in. The boys in particular were splashing in the main pool and jumping from the top infinity pool to the bottom infinity pool, this is obviously totally normal behaviour for children and they weren’t doing anything wrong BUT we paid more for an adults only hotel so we could relax and this did ruin it a bit. Saying this I appreciate it's obviously been a hard year for hotels and tourism and so maybe they let families in as a one-off to make up for the time they were closed?

A few other tips - I would definitely recommend eating at Lorraine’s Magic Hill below the hotel, amazing food and wine.

At the moment F-Zeen is affordable for a week’s holiday. As an adult’s only hotel, it is an ideal getaway retreat for a solo traveller or perfect for romantic trip for a couple.

Everything about this boutique, family owned hotel is 5*; the service, the food, the spa treatments, the nightly open-air cinema and the yoga and fitness classes that are all complimentary.

Built in to the hillside, the hotel does have a fair few steps but the gardens are stunning. With 56 rooms in total (and at the time of my visit the hotel was full), this hotel didn’t feel busy. There are three pool areas, access to a private beach and paddle boarding included too.

As many of the previous reviews have stated you do really need a hire car if you want to venture out and explore this lovely island, and there are several really good tavernas within a few minutes drive - Denis at Trapezaki beach being our favourite
The staff at the hotel were all friendly and always helpful with a smile. My wife was taken ill during our stay and the Reception staff advised me to drive her to the hospital in Argostoli without delay. She was there for 5 days undergoing a procedure which provided a fix so that she could get home for surgery.

Zero compromise on this position. I suggested that a compromise would keep both of us 'honest'; I would pay and the hotel would keep services running for the duration of the holiday.
2) Having taken money from guests Management then withdrew hotel services. The bar was closed. Guests on full board were converted to B&B and told to claim for their lunch and supper from the CAA
3) Management took to sitting in public areas e.g. in the pool bar area which further reduced the hotel services as public areas became off limits.
4) I witnessed the Manager assault a guest in reception following an altercation. The guest was a lady in her 60's.
5) Management charged the full room rate when the take it or leave it offer was made - in excess of Thomas Cook rates
6) Management dishonest communication regarding contact with the CAA.
The hotel itself is great, with a super pool area and staff - bar, kitchen, housekeeping that work really hard and are customer focused.

Quite an amazing looking place. One of the nicest place we’ve stayed at.(to a point)
Staff very friendly. Will help with many things.
Nice sized rooms. All have a great view of the sea.
The pool and area is pristine. Just had it renovated this year. So perfectly new and gorgeous. The sea view there is unforgettable. Loungers nicely separated. Not jammed together like some places.
Cleaning staff do a excellent job cleaning up the rooms. They leave it spotless. If you leave your clothes in disarray, they will fold them for you and leave them in a stack.
Bad:
There are no freebies here. Have to pay for everything even coffee in the morning. They just give you a couple packets of tea. Wifi is really annoying. Have to sign up every time. Over and over again. It times out. The worst wifi I’ve ever had at any hotel.
Same breakfast buffet every day. Change it up.
I’m glad we were staying on one of the south buildings because there is at least one dog that barks constantly and a rooster that crows whenever it want throughout the day.
Ac doesn’t work properly. Doesn’t get cool in the room. When it’s plus 30 it’s a big deal.
Ugly:
I seen the cook smoking in the snack bar kitchen while he was cooking. That’s gross.
If you like wasps/bees on your food at breakfast buffet, you’re in luck. They have that!
This place is on a hill...a very big hill. It’s fine if you’re planning on staying put there and not go anywhere. You can’t just walk down the street to another restaurant. Closest is about 15 min walk down hill. But then you have to climb up. If you’re not reasonably fit don’t try. It’ll take the wind out of you.

All the staff were very friendly and like other reviewers we were also with Thomas cook but didn’t receive any poor treatment as a result.
The hill..... fine walking down but after a day at the beach and in hot temperatures would have been a struggle to walk up but paying 5 euros is worth it. Without the hill you wouldn’t have the amazing views.
Lassi has plenty of lovely restaurants mainly traditional Greek food which suited us!
Argostoli just a short taxi ride away for 7 euros if you fancy a change of scenery.
The beach once down the hill is across the road all in all around a 10 min walk. Lovely sandy beach with shallow calm warm water! Free sun beds of you buy food or drink at the beach bar

Our first visit to kefalonia. We absolutely fell in love with lassi, Argostoli (which you can easily walk to) and kefalonia. We can't wait to return.

We've stayed in many apartments on other Greek islands and the standard here was excellent. The rooms were spotlessly clean, towels changed every 3 days, pool area was very clean, everything was very well looked after and it's in a beautiful spot. Always loads of very comfortable sunbeds around the pool.

I have to mention the hill. We are fairly fit, my partner is 55 and I'm a bit younger, and we managed it fine, we didn't get a taxi once. And the views are stunning at the top! It certainly wouldn't stop us returning.

We travelled with Thomas Cook and went home the day before they went into administration, which is very sad. I really hope it doesn't affect hotels in kefalonia. We'll be contacting the hotel directly to book in the future.

I don't really write reviews but we had to leave a review for dionysos as we loved this hotel and had such a wonderful time. I could write loads more, but it's covered on the other reviews.

Thanks for a brilliant holiday, to Maria all the team at dionysos.", September 2019, Travelled as a couple

Maria and the team are all very friendly and welcoming from bar staff to reception to the room cleaners.
The bar has the best views and Alex is always the best.
This year Thomas Cook went into administration which is very sad for all of the customers, staff and hotels and all of the businesses which rely on this company.
But everyone in Lassi including the Dionysos team, transfer drivers and the Thomas Cook reps were professional and went above and beyond.

First off I want to say we were treated fantastically especially in the wake of the Thomas Cook fall out, not once did we receive any animosity or problems we were treated as any other paying guest so Thankyou Dionysos.
We found the staff amazing so friendly and helpful, the whole complex was clean and tidy. The pool although a little cold was refreshing once you were in there was always space around the pool we never struggled to get a sun bed. Breakfast for us was good a lot of negativity from people whilst I was there around breakfast but I found it to be more than adequate for what we wanted.
Now the hill, yes it is steep getting back up and yes I can understand this is difficult for some people but as others have said 6 Euro’s and you can get a taxi.
We hired a car for the week we were there to get out and about the lady in reception called the local company and 40 mins later our car was waiting. I will be returning but obviously booking directly with the Dionysos next time we hope to see you again soon.", September 2019, Travelled as a couple

Dionysos did not disappoint. Beautiful hotel and fantastic views across the bay. spotlessly clean.
All areas were also kept very well. Gardens and pool area very clean.
Bar area very smart and comfortable.
Rooms also very comfortable.
On B&B breakfast same every day, up to yourself to vary it.
Ate in the hotel restaurant one night.......it was good.
We were well looked after for our weeks stay.
Can’t think of any downsides......a few small things...... bar ran out of lemon/ lime for drinks.
A bit more notice of Greek night rather than on the day! My friend and I had been to the Greek night at Zorba's the night before.
Regarding the hill, my friend and I are “ladies of a certain age” walking down was fine but none the less still steep! No way would we contemplate walking back up!
Taxi every time on our holiday...€5/6 from the strip where there are plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from.

As normal the whole place is amazing, spotless, clean it's just so picture card perfect.

The Pool area has been resurfaced and the old metal railings have been replaced with glass panels, up by the Bar area that has also been resurfaced.
The look of the glass panels is truly amazing.
The Bridge that goes over the Pool now has water sprinklers underneath that can be turned on.

Now, I keep reading about this hill; what part of this complex is 800+ meters UP on a side of a hill don't people understand.
I've walked down and up and there are TWO steep parts, the very start from the bottom and then it just climbs up and up until you get to the final 200 meters and that is the last steep part.

Now; you can always get a Taxi from down the Road at 6 Euro's or go to the very first shop spend around 30 to 40 Euro's and get a FREE lift with shopping back (JOB DONE).

The Rooms as normal were spotless, an excellent team of cleaners, the gardens are very well kept by the Gardner and the Pool is well looked after, the Bar has Alex and John to sever you drinks.

The hotel doesn't look fantastic from the front however once inside its fantastic. The views are amazing and everything well placed to meet the sunshine all day. Our room was very clean, bed extremely comfortable and the view from our balcony was a mix of the pool and the ocean. We were greeted by amazing staff at all times and nothing was too much, all areas were clean and kept clean throughout the day. The pool bar staff Yiannis, Thanos, and Ioanna were incredible, very engaging, full of information and are a credit to the hotel.
On the down side, the hotel for some reason allows guests from a neighbouring hotel next door to use the pool and amenities during the day. Whilst we were on holiday, a group of ""cockney chavs"", attending a wedding from the hotel next door, took over the pool area causing mayhem, the staff were constantly having to ask them to stop bringing there own food and drinks to the poolside. They were loud, drunk and smashing a glass which closed the pool one afternoon ruining fun for the families staying at the hotel.

I felt that the staff tolerated their customers. If I said hello (in Greek) to them they would say hello back but never initiated a greeting or conversation.
We've stayed in many basic Greek hotels over the years and what we have always enjoyed is the Greek hospitality and it was sadly missing at this hotel. The pool itself was lovely but the ladies poolside toilets had no locks or toilet seats. The men's ground floor toilets had red and white 'keep out' tape wrapped round the urinal.

We booked our flights, hotel and taxis independently.
This was our 1st time at this hotel, but not our 1st time in Skala.

The resort was much quieter than previous visits, which is understandable due to COVID-19.

The hotel is in a good location opposite the beach and minutes from the shops, supermarket and restaurant. (There is a short walk up a hill so be mindful if you have walking difficulties)

COVID-19
All staff are required to wear face masks and customers are required to do the same when at reception. Hand sanitisers are available.
Because of this virus the usual breakfast buffet survive was not available and we were all served at our table. There was no choice of meal options, but dietary issues were accommodated. Breakfast was outside on the terrace. This was quite charming. (Beware of the wasps though)

The rooms are a little tired and the bathrooms do flood, so an upgrade to prevent the flooding would be advantageous. (Can be a slip hazard)
We got extra bath mats to soak up the water.

We were there during two massive storms and I can’t say enough how well the staff worked to clean up the hotel and support its customers.
The pool was a disaster area with sun loungers and debris in it, it was clean and tidy within a day.
Luckily the hotel had a generator so we still had electricity and hot water.
They worked wonders to get the guests breakfast after the storms.

The team are friendly and very helpful.
It would be advantageous if WiFi was available in the rooms and not just in reception, but this is not a deal breaker.

We will definitely book another holiday here.", September 2020, Travelled as a couple

It was quieter than it would be in a normal year around the pool area and the resort in general but the hotel was full. It was easy to get sun beds and swim in the pool.

Although the rooms need a refresh/ upgrade all the positives far outweigh this!

what do you say about Yannis and his team -they make this hotel and should act as a lesson for other hotels!

Because of the nature of the hotel it sort of ‘self selects the guests’- in short if you like the hotel, you’ll get on with the other guests staying - I’ve stayed in all types of hotels all round the world and Tara Beach Hotel must be one of the friendliest I’ve ever stayed in! One morning the hotel lost its water supply (along with neighbouring hotels) for 3-4 hrs but there wasn’t a single complaint from any of the guests which wouldn’t have happened in many hotels I’ve stayed in!

Obviously being one of the oldest hotels in Skala it has a fantastic central location which makes it easy (and dangerous) for visiting all the bars and restaurants.

We arrived at Tara Beach and although COVID is with us the entry was smooth and easy. The staff took our bags to our room which was nice after a long journey. Below is our honest opinion of Tara Beach broken down.

Staff

The staff are amazing, Yiannis, Christina, Dimitris and Midas will do anything for you and are always very polite and they work their socks off. They are very easy to talk to and very kind. Cleaning staff were very good and although we were told we wouldn’t see them much we saw them everyday and they were great. A real credit to Greece.

Rooms

Rooms are of a good size and very comfortable, bed was good and comfy. Only thing I’d say is they need updating and bringing into the 2020s with new up to date furniture which would make them top class. Few tweaks there and they are great. Shower was very good and powerful. Air con £45 a week and needed.

Facilities

Facilities were very good and always available. Pool table, tv and activities available everyday.

Pool

Pool was great and very big and very deep which was nice. Very clean and well kept. Sun beds need updating as they are very uncomfortable, most places in Skala have cushioned beds now so add them and it would be an excellent addition. Added sun beds were on the beach which were the same.

Bar

Good choice of drinks and good prices. If they don’t have what you want they will get it by next day which was great service.

Area

Right on the seafront and 5 minute walk to town or two minutes to seafront bars.

Food

Bar food was delicious and well priced and good amounts on the plate.

Breakfast

We were a little disappointed with this as it’s the same everyday which gets repetitive but it’s nice just needs to be different each day to keep you coming back. With COVID the staff were doing everything so please be patient and they will serve you in the end as some people were quite rude while waiting. The staff were doing the best they could.

Overall Opinion

Overall the Tara Beach was very good and worth the money. A few tweaks to certain things and the hotel would be amazing and match all the others on that seafront that have updated themselves. That’s all that’s needed. Everything else is there and runs perfectly. A very relaxing and comfortable holiday. Thanks.", August 2020, Travelled with family

Everywhere was clean and very well maintained. The gardens were lovely and the pool area is spacious and very well kept with fantastic sea views. For the majority of the stay we had no problem finding sun loungers. However, for a couple of days people did start putting towels down very early, but after guests mentioned it to the management they had them removed - which all hotels should do. There are enough for all adult guests even when the hotel is full.
The pool side bar and restaurant is ideal for lunch.
We are already planning to return next year.
The staff, Maria, Sotoris, Martina and Panos were amazing, incredibly helpful and great with younger guests.

The hotel is still beautiful but the staff is useless and they use to put on an amazing breakfast but since they are under Thomas cook now everything is no-frills and cheap. The breakfast and pool bar food is horrible . It’s such a shame the owners invested a lot of money and didn’t look out for their investment. They lost me and my large group of travel agents . It’s also an act of God if your American or South African and trying to make a reservation. The tour company they use only caters to English clients .

You will read about the steps which are an issue. This was not helped by the fact that the internal lift was broken and the heath Robinson series of external lifts were either unfinished (contractor never finished it) or plain dangerous.

We are very fit and had no problems but with them but with over 120 many would find the climb very hard. We had half board and made use of this only twice, once for dinner the other at the pool. After this we only ate out as the food was appalling with a menu that never changed whilst there. The cooked breakfast selection was fine, but was either luke warm or cold, tables were not laid. We never used the bar but when to the town for both drinks and our meals. We never used the pool but went to one of the beaches to swim where we found that the water was warmed than the hotel pool..

The rooms are dated but functional, they were clean. It was nice to sit on the balcony in the evening with a glass of white wine admiring the view.

I cannot understand why one of the lifts is not working which it seems it has not done for months, maybe years.

There are plenty of tavernas in the near by harbour which are about a 15 minute walk, but also a few which are closer.
The staff are all very friendly kind and helpful, and work so very hard to make your stay so enjoyable.
Yes there are STEPS but you couldn't possibly expect views like that without earning them, and it keeps you fit.........
To sum it up we have found OUR little piece of paradise and will most certainly be returning.
Thank you again to you all at Bay Palace for making our holiday so special xx

The hotel is clean and the staff are super friendly and very welcoming. They endeavour to answer questions and provide their guests with info if needed. It’s also located in a pretty resort frequented by boat and yacht owners. The hotel has 2 pools with sub loungers and parasols and a poolside bar. There wasn’t a rush for the sun loungers every day as there plenty available. There is a gym which we didn’t use but saw others using it regularly. Overall, I would recommend this hotel.
Location - @15 min walk to the port where there are supermarkets, restaurants and bars. There are a few restaurants near the hotel which were all very popular.
Immediately outside the hotel there are 2 white shingle beaches with clear blue water. These are popular but not overcrowded waters that are calm and make good for snorkelling and swimming.
Hotel access - the hotel is built into the hillside and so there are a lot of steps. This should not be underestimated. My family are regular exercisers but the 160 steps to our room in the 4th layer of hotel rooms wasn’t always welcomed. That said, we did have amazing views.
Food - Food at the hotel was ok. We were half board for 10 days and the menu didn’t vary very much. This was fine for us but for any foodies you might want to go B&B and experiment with the restaurants outside the hotel. If we were to go back, we’d probably do this.
Transport - I recommend hiring a car. There are lots of steep hills and so hire a car which is more than 1 litre. We didn’t book in advance and most of the cars had already been hired out, so it’s worth booking in advance. It’s also possible to get around by bus. The bus stop is in the local port, opposite the white fronted supermarket.
Places to go - we went to Argostli, the capital purely to get sight of the turtles that reside in the bay. We walked along the dividing bridge however couldn’t see any turtles. We considered hiring a pedalo for 45 mins €20 / €30 (motorised) however after speaking to an another couple, decided to sit at one of the restaurant/bars in the bay, where we saw 4 massive turtles. There are shops in Argostoli too. Turtle gazing and shopping were the only things we did though. I recommend arriving early as parking can be tricky.
Sami- nice resort with lots of waterside restaurants. Couple of supermarkets and a few shops. Ferries to Ithaca can also be taken from Sami.
Fiscardo - beautiful place to visit. Lots of restaurants and shops. Picture perfect place where you can spend the whole day. Also a small beach located in Fiscardo. However a nicer one can be accessed on foot through a local 5 star hotel. We went by bus and were treated to gorgeous views of Myrtos Beach and Assos. Highly recommend.", August 2019, Travelled with family

They all mucked in and were brilliant the way they looked after the scores of people who turned up desperate for food- and a phone charge. They looked after everyone as if they were hotel guests, having pages of people waiting for food but all were seated and looked after.

Write a review",tc1967,"Manchester, United Kingdom",Sep 2020,50,50,"Amazing staff ! Lovely hotel, will return.","I have just returned from a week in Kefelonia with my hubby.
We arrived about 10pm on Weds night and was provided with a plate of food and several bottles of water ( much needed and appreciated) the room was really clean although I felt it was very basic and a bit dated .
Unfortunately the next morning a cyclone hit the island and the hotel was without electricity ( just some minimum emergency lighting via a generator)
(As much as this was no fault of the hotels the nobody came to speak to guests about what was happening and we had no contact from our Jet2 rep )
We went to our room to find we actually did not even have the emergency lighting so our room was in total blackout, I spoke to the manager who immediately gave me a key to another room , I was gobsmacked when I arrived at a room which was twice the size and had s private pool , obviously no good during the cyclone however the next morning we were told we could stay in this room for the duration of our holiday !! I cannot tell you how happy I was , especially when the cyclone passed ( unfortunately we had no electricity till sunday morning)

We could not use the indoor pool or the spa ( due to covid) which was a bit of a disappointment as we were not aware of this when before arrived , but understood that taking a holiday during a global pandemic meant certain restrictions were going to be in place so was not overly surprised.
We spent the rest of the holiday in our upgraded room which was amazing and the manager even moved our friends to the room next door as it was vacant .

The staff throughout the hotel were amazing, very friendly and could not do enough !
The guy who drives the bus was a star, we got mixed up with our days ( as you do on holiday) and waited for the bus on a Sunday, the bus does not run on s Sunday but he still took us to Skala .. in his car !

Food - I really enjoyed the food , always something different .
During powercut food was only lukewarm but this was not the hotels fault and I feel they did there very best given the situation. I feel the staff did the hotel proud under very difficult circumstances. !
(As soon as power was back on the food was hot again )
Due to covid staff are having to serve people which was not an issue, you could have as much as you wanted and even go up for more if you wished ( and I did a couple of times has the food was that good) , it got quite busy on occasions but again the staff did there best and were so friendly.

The views from this hotel are amazing .
There is a very steep walk down to the sea but is well worth it, we swam here a couple of days ( terraces with sunbeds down here too)
This hotel would not be suitable for someone with mobility issues due to steep hills and lots of steps .
The grounds are amazing with s lovely tiny church.
We even saw dolphins one night which was lovely.

Bus to and from the beach/Skala but no bars / tavernas close to the hotel which was a bit if s disappointment as we usually would go for an evening walk and a few drinks, however hotel was nice enough to spend the evening in so was not a night issue .

Skala - lovely island with amazing views but there is not a lot close by , I would love to visit again ( when we are not in a pandemic and without the cyclone) however would definitely hire a car so I could see more of the island.

Would I visit this hotel again - most definately , the management should be very proud of their staff, they do an amazing job ! Wish I knew the name of the manager who sorted our rooms out , he was amazing and could not do enough to help !
Thank you for s lovely stay !", September 2020, Travelled as a couple

Write a review",Nicky4116,"Newmarket, United Kingdom",Sep 2020,40,50,OK but needs improvement,"The Hotel
Put simply, this hotel is not 5 star, I would say its more of a 3.5.
The hotel is in a nice spot overlooking the sea. Note, it’s on the side of a hill so there are lots of different levels meaning lots of stairs. Don’t go to this hotel if you aren’t very mobile.
In terms of what is around the hotel, the simple answer is nothing. So, if you want somewhere where you can walk to local restaurants, this probably isn’t the hotel for you. They do offer a free mini bus service several times a day to and from Skala, and once a day to Poros so you can get out an about without spending a fortune on taxis and there is a bus stop opposite the hotel, although we never saw a local bus while we were there, but they may have been due to Covid. It is possible to walk into Skala which is about 3.5Km away and there is a path all the way. It’d downhill going to Skala so if you want to do it one way, get the taxi or bus for the return journey!
The hotel was clean and they’d taken good steps in terms of Covid protection. There were plenty of bottles of hand sanitizer everywhere and indicators about maintaining 2m distance. There were a few slip ups i.e. a member of staff serving without facemask/screen on and allowing guests with kids to let the kids run around the restaurant.
Arrival
We arrived quite late at about 10.20pm (coach transfer from the airport took about 1.5 hours) and, as we were the only couple arriving, check in was quick. There was quite a bit of paperwork to fill out, some of it for Covid, but that was not a major problem. Some basics of the hotel were explained and we were given a handout explaining the all-inclusive service (I am guessing this replaced what you would normally get in the room). The staff were friendly and the provided us with plates of food to take to our room. We appreciated the gesture, but it didn’t look nice!
We were taken to our room on the electric golf carts they use to get around the complex. It was quite an experience trying to balance a chicken dinner on your lap while sitting on the back of a golf buggy!
We didn't try the indoor pool as it was closed and we didn't explore the Spa option either. I am not even sure if this was open.

The room
The main observation about our room was that it had a fantastic view over the pool and the sea. It was a large room and an extremely large balcony – we could have had a party out there! The décor of the room was positively dated and everything just looked tired and in need a refurb.
The bathroom had a bath with shower over plus a separate shower and toilet cubical. Again, there was plenty of room, but it also needed a bit of a refit.
The beds were two twins pushed together, which meant we just kept falling down the middle and the sheets didn’t fit the mattresses (too small) so you woke up every morning sleeping directly on the mattress and the sheets in complete disarray. The pillows were also quite cheap and not very comfortable. On the positive side, the bed was very comfortable, probably one of the most comfortable hotel mattresses I have had. Usually they are as hard as rock or so soft you are swallowed up in them. This one was just right.
The room had particularly good aircon and it was quiet, so it was OK to have it on at night. There was a small (and I mean small) safe in the room which you could hire a key for 3 Euros a day – which we thought was a bit of a rip off given most hotels these days have safes with combination locks and don’t charge for them. There was a fridge but nothing in it and no tea and coffee making facilities due to Covid. Cleaning was done every other day which was fine and, to be honest, all hotels should do it to save costs.
The Food
We were on the all-inclusive package so we could dine in the main buffet restaurant for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. We also had the option of one meal in the a la carte restaurant (more on this later) and we could eat in the poolside snack bar but not between 12.30pm and 2.30pm (or there abouts) which was just weird.
Given the Covid situation, I think the hotel handled the buffets pretty well. You weren’t allowed to serve yourself so had to indicate to the staff what you wanted and they served you. This was generally OK although there were a few times where there weren’t enough staff serving. However, in the hotel’s defence, the number of people who seemed to be in the hotel seemed to change daily so staffing must have been a nightmare.
The buffet was more limited than what you would normally expect but the food was edible and comparable with other all-inclusive buffets I’ve had. I would say, I think that because there were fewer dishes, there were more Greek dishes, or at least there appeared to be, which was a dramatic improvement over most other all inclusive buffets that seem to go out of their way not to serve local food. The Moussaka was particularly good.
Lunch in the pool snack bar (well, late breakfast or late lunch given it wasn’t open at lunch time?) was a basic offering of salad, pizza and a range of sandwiches. It was all cooked in the main restaurant and brought down to the snack bar rather than using the kitchen down there. Again, this was obviously because of Covid and that the hotel wasn’t full. It was OK food wise but nothing to write home about and it was nice to sit by the pool rather than up in the restaurant.
We did manage to go to the A la Carte restaurant, but to be honest, it wasn’t very good. I think the day we went was the only day it was open the whole time we were there and we think it was only open because the hotel Manager was entertaining some sort of big cheese. You had a choice of two menus, all-inclusive and then a larger menu which was extra. The extra menu wasn’t any more appealing than all-inclusive, so we stuck with that. There was no choice for dessert as well, but as it turned out, this was the best part of the meal. The food in general was poor and you could get better in the buffet. Style over substance comes to mind with this restaurant.
The good thing about all the restaurants was that you could sit outside and overlook the sea. Also, although there was a dress code for dinner, it was relaxed and the men could wear long shorts.

The Drink
The all-inclusive drinks were fine. They had a good selection of wines for an all-inclusive option and they didn’t mind serving you the bottle rather than doing it by glass as a lot of all-inclusive place insist on. The cocktails, I don’t know as I don’t like cocktails. The biggest disappointment was that Metaxa Greek brandy wasn’t on the all inclusive ☹

The pool
The pool area was nice and the pool is very large (although incredibly cold) with lovely views over the sea. The pool was cleaned every day and there were plenty of loungers to choose from given the hotel wasn’t full. It didn’t matter what time you went to the pool; you could get a lounger so there’s no need to get up at the crack of dawn!
The main problem with the pool area was the decking which was, quite frankly, dangerous in places. As with the rooms, this area of the hotel needs a complete refurb. The decking was uneven, warped and there were sections that were a real trip hazard. Equally, the tiling on the outside of the pool was in a poor way with lots of missing tiles.

The service
I have seen mention on other reviews of this hotel that the staff were a bit grumpy. We did find that, particularly among the male restaurant staff. The star member of staff was “Dimi” who ran the pool bar. She is a complete star and the hotel should give her a pay rise and ask her to train all the staff in how to interact with customers. She was friendly, learnt and remembered our names and chatted away to us. When we needed to know something, she was the first person to ask. She also ran the snack bar and it was the only place you could guarantee there would be olive oil at the table. This was served in sachets because of Covid, but she made sure there was some on each table, unlike in the main restaurant where it was hit and miss, mainly miss and you ended up having to wait an age to get the attention of one of the staff to ask for it.
We did see the manager several times during our stay, but he didn’t appear to make any attempt to talk to the guests. Says a lot really.
Communication was an area that I think the hotel could improve on. This became particularly apparent when the island was hit with a Cyclone which took out the power for over 48 hours. We weren’t really told much or kept informed of the situation other than a single typed sheet on reception and the staff at reception didn’t seem to want to answer our questions.

Would I go back? No, probably not, but despite that, we had a lovely holiday and I think they did a great job of making our holiday feel as normal as possible.", September 2020,

Write a review",Shelly, ,Sep 2020,40,50,Relaxing break,"Having returned from the lovely island of Kefalonia, we found this hotel not a five star as it states. However, it was very clean with beautiful views, requested & received a top floor quiet room, we also felt Covid safe.
We were in the Superior room which needed decorating & sealant around bathroom fittings.
Hairdryer was defected & I had to buy a Travel hairdryer at the resort.
No iron in the room, had to keep requesting reception for the hotel iron!
Safe in the room which you have to pay for.
We stayed B&B, breakfast was very bland, but, they are lots of Taverns & Restaurants that serve good quality food at reasonable prices, much cheaper than the hotel.
Hotel reception staff where very friendly, professional & efficient.

From the moment you enter the hotel you are greeted with a most friendly reception staff and that friendly service followed us through the stay. The views from the hotel are stunning, the food is very good, though there could be more choice. The swimming pool is very good with lovely view. All in all, this is very nice place, with a most friendly and professional reception staff.", August 2020,

Write a review",Ologhlen,"London, United Kingdom",Sep 2020,30,50,holiday,"Id say 4 star not 5. Staff make it - thanks to Demitri, lola Demi (superb) and eva.
Asked for rooms to be cleaned everyday as otherwise only twice a week including towel change due to corona - less people in your room? Cleaners all wore over coverings and masks which was good. Standard of cleaning mostly good - if not it was soon sorted. No issues with requesting more towels or hangers - 4 hangers for a two week stay in superior room?
Room design fantastic views of beautiful scenery but beds and furniture tired and bathrooms dark and no places to hang towels etc.
Food very basic - fine but very limited fish and should have more greek food and less pasta chips full English etc.
Only cheese was a small bowl of feta at breakfast or plastic processed slices. Very little fresh fruit.
Had to wait ages for luke warm coffee /tea etc as they wanted to avoid people hanging around coffee machines etc I suppose so waiter service, but again , not enough staff.
The waiters were half hearted but don't blame then as hot and repetitive. only 3 staff on average for 6 stations - so long waits - cannot imagine how it would operate if hotel was at full capacity.
Pool and views incredible.
Lovely small rock snorkel platform but was left fairly filthy and only swept half way through our stay.
I would suggest hiring a car as beautiful island.
Great restaurants to visit is the nautilus just to the left of the hotel (25 min walk ) or car and the Agropida family restaurant in Poros - incredible views, value and food.
Should open reception bar at lunch time , not 4.oo as again beautiful views - but this maybe due to limited staff again due to corona?
Lovely stay but we paid full whack as booked last year before pandemic and would not pay that amount again for that holiday.", August 2020,

Write a review",Chrissie, ,Sep 2020,40,50,Excellent Staff & Accommodation,"Lovely resort, be aware the whole complex is on a steep hill, but a driver will pick you up & drive you around the complex to reception, restaurant etc.
Not so Good: Many slopes & steps to get around complex. Complex is in between 2 small towns, quite remote & perfect to switch off the quick pace of like in the U.K.
Our standard room was next to noisy metal fire exit steps. Many guests used these as a quick route to facilities.
On our 1st night we had just 4 hrs sleep, then woken at 6am by loud clumping feet, children shouting to echo. Evening was a nightmare as heels of all types clattered until 2am, after too much alcohol!
Next morning we saw the lovely Manager who knew our room was noisy.
He kindly drove us around to view options. 4 of 6 luxury villas were empty for our 2 week stay, we chose 1 with it's own private pool, twice weekly gardeners, maid service changed bed linen every 2 days. Free mini bar drinks, chocs & snacks top up each night. Plus a driver on call from our room phone, to drive us up to any areas of the complex.
We paid a very reasonable price for this luxury. Even the tv worked on UK channels.
We plan to return at least once more.", May 2020, Travelled as a couple

Write a review",Katarina_B,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",Sep 2020,50,50,"Perfect holiday, a few things to improve!!","We booked B&B but upgraded to AI for 30€ per person per day as things are quite pricey otherwise. They only allow you to upgrade for 5 consecutive days minimum and when we wanted to do 5, 2 days off and then 3 (as it was the end of our stay and we couldn’t do 5 more), it was an issue to go via the manager etc. I think they should keep it simple and say - book a minimum of 5 days during your stay, the rest is optional. As people want to go out, enjoy a trip or even stay elsewhere overnight.

- Rooms - Greek standard, not 5-star. I’d say 3-4 star.
- Food delicious - they usually have someone managing the one way traffic at the restaurant. As soon as they weren’t they, some people started to behave like sheep running up and down while we were queuing, waiting to be asked in.
- Food service - served by chefs who don’t quite understand and have absolutely no customer service skills. We sometimes felt like we were causing them inconvenience by asking for food. I feel they weren’t excited to do it either! They were constantly running into the kitchen as I believe they were cooking and serving at the same time.
- Breakfast - now can mini pastries run out all the time? I’m not joking, we weren’t even being late. They tell you it’s finished. Well, add it to the oven again as it’s meant to be all inclusive for everyone not just the first 10 guests in the morning!
- Waiters - lovely
- Ala carte restaurant - the same food as downstairs just different presentation but amazing views and nice atmosphere!
- The views of the sea are the best!!
- Pool - consistent depth and safe with a life guard
- Gym - not enough lighting which made it unsafe. 1 treadmill and 1 bike, a few weights.
- Pool bar - sufficient selection of drinks, the pool restaurant pizza was amazing, much nicer than the upstairs one.
- Pool bar music - I’m sure the same 20 songs kept playing the entire time. Either switch to a local radio or add more songs so the guests don’t go crazy.
- Cliffs to the sea, not good access tbh
- Housekeeping - I requested every day so the lady could get extra hours, otherwise they only clean twice a weak.
- Room - we had to request a kettle, no milk or cream
- free hotel transfer to Poros and Skala
- Entertainment - embarrassing. Every night a husband and wife singing and dancing. He can’t dance, she can’t sing. He looks like he hates it, she loves it. We couldn’t figure out the themes of their songs and dances, no light on them, sat on the darkest corner. Very bad and I think they could maybe perform twice a week max and then some real entertainment could improve the standards. Surely they have some quality talents in Kefalonia who could visit. It doesn’t even need to be every night, there can be a couple of quiet nights, or run workshops, crafts etc. Variety would be good. This is not sustainable.
- People lovely, staff friendly, hotel clean, amazing food and views. I’d return 100%!! Particularly now when it’s not busy.", August 2020, Travelled as a couple

Write a review",k175ty, ,Aug 2020,50,50,Amazing. 100% recommend,"We stayed here as a family in August 2020 for a week , half board.2 adults and 2 children aged 11 and 8.
I was amazed from the moment we arrived at the hotel.
It is beautiful.
We were given cold bottles of water on arrival and our suitcases were steam cleaned ( sanitised) while we checked in.
We were very lucky to get a free room upgrade (we had a suite with jacuzzi) .
We were taken to our room via a lovely man and his golf buggy. He was very chatty and polite and a real gentleman.
We had a few very minor issues with the room which were dealt with very promptly ...like i say MINOR ISSUES. The customer relations manager arranged some free drinks for us to apologise though this was really not necessary.
There are a lot of steps which adds character to the place and offers amazing views, however, just a quick call to reception and they will have the golf buggy pick you up ASAP should you struggle with steps/mobility.
Food a little repetitive but very nice.
Shuttle bus daily (free of charge) to town/beach and back. The driver is prompt and very accommodating. He is a really friendly guy who takes great pride in his job.
Restaurant/bar/hotel staff all very friendly and really make you feel welcome.
Cannot find any faults and cant wait to come back
Tips..
buy a snorkel...the sea/fish are amazing.

Buy water shoes for the shingle beach(skala)

Take nibbles from the restaurant for the stray cats...they're super cute.

Take nibbles for the fish at the dock.

Be aware..
There are ants around the site ( as expected given you're in the mountains) however, these were no bother to us.

Lookout for ..
The mountain goats and the zebra striped butterflies ...oh...and fruit trees EVERYWHERE! VERY pretty", August 2020, Travelled with family

Write a review",CJCole, ,Aug 2020,20,50,Checked out after 2 hours,"I can only echo what Debrajane has said below, reasons for which I checked my family out of this place. 5 star??? I’m afraid it has a very long way to go.
The website visuals are very professionally done. The pool area is dire, with cheap uncomfortable sun beds. The pool is not inviting with cracked tiles. The beach is a long long way down. The rooms are very basic, the bathroom had a shower in the toilet !!!!!! Yuk..
The poolside restaurant serves Brit style cafe menu.. spag Bol.. burger.. pizza... not the fabulous Greek cuisine we were lucky enough to experience down in Skala. Looking at the “honest review” posted, I think we were extremely fortunate as we had booked half board. I would have been devastated to miss out on the fantastic tavernas and their menus. We were a family of 3 and a good meal with wine was between 50/60 euros. My teenager eats as an adult.
We were committed to paying for a 5 star hotel at 5 star prices. I am so pleased I took the decision to leave.. I hadn’t made a payment at this point as booked direct. A deposit was not made as I was worried about being added to the quarantine list and the hotel very kindly agreed that full payment could be made on arrival. Thank goodness!
The rooms are set on a hillside. We are not unfit, the stairs were a struggle on the only occasion I used them.
I would not recommend this hotel, the location is remote and away from the glorious beach at Skala, and the many restaurants that are all highly rated on here. We went on to have a lovely week staying in Skala and opposite the beach with a fabulous pool on the complex. We always book good hotels but felt that the family complexes in this area are far better than the apostolata resort. The families have a vested interest in ensuring a high quality service and if I visit again, I will opt for this type of establishment.
I rely on trip advisor for good honest feedback. I am pleased that the recent postings have been able to express the experience that I had. Do take note. I feel fortunate that I was able to leave, having sourced alternative accommodation on booking.com. If it was not in Covid times, I doubt we would have found anything else and would have come home, it was that disappointing.
The staff I did encounter were lovely.", August 2020,

Cold drinks were provided while our cases were taken to our rooms and from that moment were looked after by everyone and given a wonderful holiday.

The staff worked tirelessly to ensure that the hotel was spotlessly clean, that the guests felt reassured and most importantly had a good holiday. Most of what I wanted to comment on has been mentioned by so many other reviewers previously.

The volume of repeat customers and visitors that we saw during our week away and that have commented on Tripadvisor confirms the popularity of the hotel. This is a relatively small hotel and we always found sunbeds around the pool area to be available and plenty of space to be found on the beach when social distancing demands or makes the visitor feel more reasssured on the safety aspects.

Our original trip to Samos was cancelled due to COVID 19. We looked again at our options and decided to go to Skala in Kefalonia.
We had been let down last year with our choice of hotel but NOT this time!

The Anassa is literally a 5 minute walk from the centre of Skala but has such a perfect position overlooking the fabulous blue sea. If I was picky I might wish that there was no road between the beach and hotel, but when we were there the road was not busy.
The hotel has a number of beach beds (8 euro for 2). From the front row you just look into a clear,blue,sparkly sea. The beach is fantastic, a little stony and it gets quite deep quickly, but perfect!

The pool is also perfect, good size and looks like an infinity pool - so at an angle looks like it links into the sea. Lots of beds and close to the bar and restaurant.

The check-in was simple and we were quickly shown to our room - we had a great room, modern with some cooking facilities, modern bathroom and side sea view which we weren’t expecting, but were delighted with.
Very happy with room 214.

The hotel is family run and the customer service goes above and beyond. Hercules, Nick and Maria gave us such a good service, remembered our names and what we regularly ordered. They worked so hard to make sure we had everything we needed.
Specially ordered peanuts and Metaxa 7 in for us to enjoy. They also had to deal with all of the extra work COVID 19 has brought.

We regularly had lunch at the hotel and the Greek Salad was the best. They also do a mean bacon baguette.

This is a hotel you will want to return to - we definitely will.", August 2020,

The 2 pools are great and all public areas are nicely furnished to welcome you to enjoy and relax. Great access to the sea for a swim. Service was great. We were there during the hurricane and despite the chaos going on the staff still did whatever they could to help you. Some of the guests were still very demanding on the staff even during a direct hit of a massively destructive storm and the staff kept up their great service. Despite the driving sideways rain and 85 mph winds. They supplied breakfast, lunch and dinner for free in our rooms, until it was safe outside. Luckily they had a couple of generators that supplied power to the main building and for water. Buffet breakfast was very nice, with a huge variety of choices. We had a room with a side sea view terrace. Nice room, with comfy large bed. The bathrooms are large with great shower. The hotels is on the north east, so you have a great views across the sea to the Islands of Lefkada and Ithaca. Many guests we spoke to at the Emelisse return every single year and I understand why.

What really stood out was the service. Everyone was so kind and attentive but especially Panos at the breakfast and pool area made sure to grant any wish we had.
If you choose to stay at the Emelisse we really recommend that you visit Soritis at the spa for a massage. We had the deep tissue massage and it was the best we ever had.

Emplisi beach was one of my favourites on the island and only a short walk away. There is a regular shuttle bus into Fiscardo, very handy. Both pool areas are spacious with outstanding views. Breakfast was extensive and restaurant food was also very tasty! They had no problem letting us stay to use the pool on our last day after we'd checked out.

The bad: parking/check in was a nightmare. Without arrival instructions we found ourselves backing up and down roads, calling on intercoms and eventually being directed to park on the side of the main road for the duration of our stay as the hotel parking was full (!). Once in the room we were disappointed - we opted for the sea view/shared pool and for the price, the room was very dark requiring lights on even during the day. We had pre-ordered a bottle of wine for the room which wasn't there - when was asked about it they said they took it off the bill, but since they didn't even provide an itemised bill we're not even sure. Due to COVID, there is also not really a 'spa' which was not clear at all on the website. Some of the staff were friendly, but in general they were indifferent.

Of the 4 places we stayed in Kefalonia, ranging from 70EUR (an apartment) to 300+EUR (Emelisse) this was definitely the worst value for money. If you're only going to take some pretty photos then Emelisse is for you, but if you're expecting a luxury experience, go elsewhere.", September 2020,

Right under the observation deck there is access to the rocky shore for unforgettable swimming in emerald waters. I preferred it over the nearby gorgeous beach just 5' minutes away that tends to get busy in August.

Rooms are basic but clean, comfy beds & nice balcony sizes. Small fridge to keep drinks cold, airers on the balconies to dry to towels. Much more than you’d normally get at similar hotels. Safety deposit box & aircon extra but only around €45 euro for both.

Pool area is clean tidy & situated high up looking over a beautiful coast line. Sun loungers are relatively new & never some not free. It’s nice and quiet around the pool during so you can really relax.

Food was good & all you needed for a lunch. Different specials every day if you were also eating dinner at the hotel. Breakfast was traditional bed & breakfast. Toast, cereal, fruits & boiled eggs.

Town is roughly a 15min walk through a gate by the pool. It’s quite a steep hill. €5 for a taxi back to the hotel if you didn’t want to walk it.

Outstanding cocktails. Delicious homemade food. All in all a fantastic little spot, we'll definitely be back.

There are, however, a couple of things I'd wish I'd known before going: given the COVID situation, the staff are being *very* cautious. I do not mean this as a criticism as it's absolutely right they want to take precautions but it didn't impact our stay in ways we would have planned differently for, had we known.
- The normal restaurant is not open in the evening and there are only light appetisers. Whilst very delicious, there was not enough variety to go every night.
- There are also no restaurants within walking distance (the close one on google maps is closed this Summer) and all but 2 (on the beach, didn't like the one we went to) are 10+ minutes drive away.
- There is zero kitchen equipment, so we couldn't even prep our own food in the kitchen and no food from the hotel was allowed to be taken back to the rooms so we couldn't save lunch for dinner.
- No kitchen equipment in the room means no wine glasses/bottle opener, so bring your own!

First off, incredible setting, fantastic views, wonderful staff.

The hotel is doing it's best to adapt to the unusual situation we all find ourselves in. This means basically most stuff is working but with some changes:

-breakfast is not buffet style, but the v kind staff will serve you whatever you'd like from the buffet

- the staff are wearing masks and gloves, some guests are, some guests aren't

-all the loungers are in use but are sprayed after each use

-room cleaning is available but not a given each day. We haven't requested it but apparently they will come in provided your stuff is put to one side

-beach towels are available but you can't change them during your stay

-kitchenettes in rooms are not to be used

-breakfast is abundant, lunch and dinner are v limited. Dinner is eg choice of 2 salads, meat and cheese platter, or burgers (meat or veggie). Fruit salad. Veggie burgers are genuinely great.

The taverna within walking distance and next door hotel are currently closed but you can walk down to the beach where 2 restaurants are open (lunch and dinner). About 20 minutes down to the beach (pleasant walk), 30 minutes back up. The way back is VERY sweaty (anytime before sunset) but fine if you're moderately fit.

We've chosen not to rent a car so thats all we can access. More on offer with wheels.

Taxi from the airport is 60-80 euro one way.

Period.,"This is our second visit to this EXCEPTIONAL hotel. We made reservations for our next visit before settling the bill, that’s how incredible the service, food and atmosphere, owners and staff are.

Please, note my selection of the first picture. Yianni and Voula are the owners. I ask all my readers, to consider when is the last time you sought out the amazing hospitality team to get pics with before leaving?

Yes, this island is special, and special to me. My father was born a couple miles from Petani Bay. The island is one of the most beautiful in Greece. Along with the other Ionian islands, it is a hidden gem. The reason we experienced every part of the island was due to the expert recommendations of Voula, who’s knowledge helped provide us with “concierge service” both on and off property.

They know every restaurant and owner by name, they suggest itineraries and put every little touch (including having your favorite bottle at the bar) into your stay.

As a hospitality professional with 35 years of experience, these are the people I spend my money and time with. They are the best in the business and I recommend this property to anyone looking for the best in Greek Hospitality!

We can honestly say that our stay in Petani Bay was the highlight for us both!

We arrived later than planned, but the lovely owners, John and Voula, welcome us with huge smiles and a well-needed welcome drink. We met their wonderful dog, Sandy, who was incredibly friendly and never a problem throughout our 5 night stay.

John and Voula were superb hosts. We always found them very easy to communicate with and they were keen to help us in any way that they could. They were even kind enough to post something we had left at the hotel after our departure! They also arranged all of our travel and even offered on occasion to drive/collect us from nearby places.

All of the staff were fantastic throughout, they were very friendly and helpful. They patiently taught us Greek when we asked them too, gave us some wonderful recommendations to help us on the rest of our Greek Adventure and answered all of our questions quickly and effectively.

The food at the hotel is great - although it is fair to say it is more expensive than some of the nearby tavernas. Unfortunately we travelled without a car and so were restricted to eat in the places nearby. However, there are a few tavernas nearby serving local Greek dishes which are delicious and inexpensive.

Petani Beach itself is awesome too! Beautiful crystal clear waters with polished white stone beaches. If you visit, be sure to hire some kayaks or a pedal boat to get around to some of the more secluded beaches as these are a lovely place to relax.

We loved our stay in Petani Bay Hotel and wouldn’t change a thing about the time we spent there. We highly recommend visiting and we are looking forward to returning at some point in the future to celebrate an anniversary!", August 2019, Travelled as a couple

On arrival we were warmly welcomed by Voula and her team and we had a drink to start unwinding.

The suite we had was lovely. A sitting area, 2 doors over a balcony, tv with Netflix, table/chairs and a new kitchenette with microwave, tea and coffee, kettle and cups/glasses as well as a fridge with a bottle of water in it.

There was a welcome message and small gifts as well as a bottle of wine on ice. The room was very clean.

The bed was comfortable, as were the pillows which you don’t often get in Greece we have found.

The bathroom was big enough, had his and hers sinks, a power/rain style shower and lots of room in the shower area.

One small niggle was the curtains were not dark enough and lots of light came in the rooms but this is common in many Greek resorts.

The bar area was nicely furnished and had lots of shade. George was very helpful behind the bar.

The pool was lovely and there were many areas around to lay out on sun beds and the bigger double beds, it never seemed overcrowded.

All the staff were very helpful and friendly including the cleaner and the domestic staff.

Voula was very approachable, friendly and helpful. She took me took the local shop for supplies and also picked us up after a meal/drinks at one of the restaurants at Petani - see other reviews. We also got a lift from George into town 1 day also. Great service !

We didn’t eat at the restaurant on site but we had breakfast everyday and there was a decent choice. Douwe egberts coffee, various teas, honey, yoghurt, fruit, eggs and omelettes as well as various cakes and fresh oranges to juice.

There were plenty of seats to relax around the place and Voula was a font of knowledge for the island.

We found the Wi-fi very hit and miss daily and the music played a little repetitive.

It’s a great place to stay - the nearby beach/area is very good too and whilst it’s by the side of the road down to the beach, generally it wasn’t too noisy.

A very relaxing stay and highly recommended for a chilled time and no kids !

Based on reviews and a good deal on offer we chose the Aeolos Beach hotel and we weren’t disappointed, this small family run hotel is perfect for a nice relaxing getaway in the sun.

The hotel is perched in the hills overlooking Skala beach, the views from the pool area are amazing and the pictures online don’t do justice to the actual stunning vistas. The sunrise comes up over the horizon directly facing the restaurant/pool and then sets behind the hills at the rear of the property at around five pm so it also cools down nicely around this time of the day. The hotel is not overlooked nor are there any other neighbouring properties in any direction, it’s a really charming and tranquil set up. The access road up from the main beach road is quite steep so not ideal for people with accessibility problems, a hire care or taxi would be recommended in this case.

Owners Chris and Angela are the perfect hosts, looking after your every need throughout the day and night, nothing was ever too much trouble, by the second day Chris remembered all our names and preferences when ordering meals and drinks etc. The staff are all so attentive even whilst they are operating the hotel at full capacity with less staff than normal due to the current pandemic.

B&B breakfast is generally continental but on some days there are extras like sausages, cooked eggs, spinach pie. Usually you would help yourself buffet style but to maintain social distancing Chris and his team take your breakfast orders and bring your food directly to the table and nothing was ever too much trouble.

The lunch menu is nice and varied, we tried different food each day and the portion sizes are quite big. Sadly food service currently stops at 4pm due to COVID so we never got to experience evening meals which is a shame but no problem as we ventured out each night eating at different restaurants along Skala beach front and in the central village which is about a 20 minute walk from the hotel.

Ice cold local beers are served in big frozen pint glasses, there’s a decent cocktail menu and a daily Captain’s hour from 6pm - 8pm to help soften the impact on the credit card. Micheal who was working the bar in the evenings is also a top class mixologist and very friendly.

The pool and surrounding area is spotlessly clean and there are plenty of sunbeds, I understand that the hotel was full during our stay but the pool area was generally quiet most days and such a great place to relax with low music playing in the background throughout the day. The fresh water pool is perfect, a little on the cooler side but not enough to put you off from a nice refreshing dip. The sunbeds are made out of heavy wood with a comfy mattress topper so they feel really sturdy and comfortable for a day relaxing by the pool overlooking Skala beach.

Highly recommended and would definitely return in the future. A few people we spoke to are enduring return guests which speaks volumes.", September 2020, Travelled as a couple

Chris and Angela run a great hotel and offer the sort of personal touch that I doubt you will find in many other places around the world let alone in Kefalonia. They seemed to remember everyone's names on site. Nothing was ever too much for them and the service at breakfast was excellent. Every member of staff adhered to the islands covid regulations around face mask wearing and we never felt at risk at any point. It's clear that people come back to this hotel time and time again and should we visit Kefalonia again it will certainly be at the top of our list. The pool and bar area are perfect for relaxing around and the proximity to the beach was fantastic. Barely a three minute walk.

A quick search on the internet for accommodation and Aeolos Beach Hotel came up and appeared to suit our needs and from the write ups we felt lucky to be able to book so late.

Aeolos Beach Hotel is a small, friendly hotel nicely perched on the hillside over looking the beach at the end of the resort. It has fabulous views and yet just a couple of minutes walk from the beach. A perfect location for us.

Travelling with my wife and 2 teenage boys we were greeted by Angela and her husband Chris and given a briefing of the hotel and how they were managing COVID then shown our rooms adjacent reception.

First impressions were really good. The whole place was immaculately clean, tidy and well kept. We felt from the first few moments we had stumbled upon a gem of a place.

Chris, Angela, their family and staff have been wonderful hosts and could not have done more to make our stay more safe, comfortable and enjoyable. Due to COVID the normal self service buffet breakfast was served expertly by Chris as were all drinks from the bar to your table. The small team worked extremely hard to ensure all guests were well looked after. The service is 5 star and nothing is too much trouble.

A sign of a good place can often be the number of returning guests and conversations with others around the hotel revealed many had several visits under their belts. We certainly felt like newbies!

If you are looking for a place to relax in immaculate accommodation, with excellent service in a fabulous beach resort all at a great price you need look no further.

Would we come back? In a heartbeat!

PS. I hope to see Chris and Angela without masks next time so we know what they look like! They did not take their masks off in all the time we were there. The Greeks are serious about his horrible virus!

The hotel is always immaculately clean and welcoming which is why we had every confidence that the hotel would be a safe choice in a COVID-19 world. We were one of the first TUI guests to go to the hotel on 2nd August once TUI re-started flights to Kefalonia and were not disappointed.

Chris, Angela and Family did everything possible to make guests feel welcome and safe whilst enabling us to have the best possible holiday. Sun beds were spread out with additional beds added to the opposite side of the pool. Surfaces and chairs were wiped down and disinfected after use, and hand sanitiser was available throughout the hotel including in bedrooms.

The breakfast which is normally a continental buffet breakfast, was instead served to your table and included some hot options for which choices were rotated each day. The bar food menu had been updated slightly from previous years but with some new choices and the food is of a high quality and delicious.

The bar is a lovely setting overlooking the pool and stunning Ionian sea view. Chris and Andreas were happy to serve drinks to your table and there is a comprehensive cocktail menu to enjoy.

As a family, we felt safe in Skala, all the restaurants were good and Covid-19 compliant. Face masks were only required in shops and all enforced this. All restaurants, hotel and retail staff across the resort of Skala wore face masks at all times.

If you are considering a holiday this year but were worried about how hotels were handling COVID 19 requirements to keep their guests safe, I would highly recommend the Aeolos Beach, who whilst taking COVID-19 safety responsibilities seriously, still found the time to put those special touches in place to give us great holiday as always.", August 2020,

I booked directly with the hotel, and they couldn't have been more helpful, organising taxis to and from the airport, filling the mini fridge before our arrival, outlining all the safety precautions in place. The location is stunning, we had a family room looking over the pool and sea view, with a large balcony. We were temperature checked on arrival, the room was frequently steam cleaned, all staff wore masks (we didn't need to). The room was NOT a 4 star, it was comfy enough, but the bunk bed was pretty unsteady and there was a permanent problem with the shower, which needed photos to get through the language barrier (but still wasn't resolved).

I wouldn't say the hotel was 4 star but I didn't see it at a full summer season. I have travelled to many islands in Greece as well as various trips around the world, and by all those standards I would suggest its a 3.

BUT. In answer to other reviews. The chef Maria was amazing and working in a very challenging time. We took time to chat with her, she made anything and everything we asked for, including asking the children every morning what they would like for dinner (we were half board). Imagine being used to cooking in a kitchen for 4 times as many people as you currently can, having to serve the food outside without the normal kitchen staff and space around you, and wanting to show the best of the cuisine. Her mussels, chicken dishes and moussaka were to die for.. At breakfast her homemade yoghurts were delicious. The only thing I didn't really love was the desserts - mainly cream and dry cake - but that I had had elsewhere it isn't a fault of the hotel, its more that I don't like that sort of thing. One night she handmade chocolates, they were delicious.

The barmaids were great, really lovely people trying to make the best effort for everyone. If you take the time to talk to them (yes even the one that doesn't speak such good English) you will find out a lot about them and how they have experienced their summer. We had great personal service - i think only 10 or 12 rooms could have been occupied whilst we were there.

The thing really missing from the hotel was music, or some form of entertainment of some type in the evening. Not necessarily a cabaret, jazz hands and talking parrots, just something to give a bit of atmosphere in the evening. The dinner finished and the bar literally shut at 9:30

It is about a 20 min walk DOWN to Skala, 40 mins back UP in the heat (it was over 40 degrees when we were there). We used the minibus a few times. We ate in Skala twice, it was ok. Kids loved the pool (which was never too busy) and the little bay. Strangely they didn't enjoy the beach at Skala, the sand was too sandy or something.

No excursions running in the area so we hired a car, through the hotel, for one day - we got a great deal considering by then it was a Greek National Holiday. We drove 3/4 of the island in that day and saw so much - the turtles, the super-blue beaches, Fiskardo and the mega yachts, high mountains and monasteries. It was amazing.

Overall, we absolutely loved our holiday, which as a family we desperately needed.", August 2020,

Rooms are basic but most of Greece is anyway. The location is a 45min walk from Skala Town, the 2 bays directly infront of the hotel are spectacular, my children loved to explore, snorkel and rock jump, its honestly breath taking. On the bay to the right if you rick climb the the front of the rock their is holes that are 8ft deep by 6ft crystal clear and warm like a hottub, like something off the discovery channel. Take seashoes, you defo need them.

Staff are all very friendly. Now food..... isn't great in our opinion, nothing really for children what so ever, the lady that does the food piles it on and i mean she does that at breakfast and dinner. I booked half board and we only ate here half of the time on an evening.
Daytime there is 2 barmaids, one speaks good English the other doesn't, the one that doesn't has no idea how to pull a pint, order food correctly, most customers seemed to complain. She is lovely but she just needs training bless her.

Pool is lovely and pool area is very clean. The hotel runs a bus service that will take u to skala for €1pp which you just book at reception. Everything you buy at bar/bus you dont pay for there and then you pay at the end upon check out.

This hotel just needs a little love, a new chef and some staff training. I would stay here again purely on the basis that we loved the bays infront of the hotel, but I would only book b&b. It could be amazing if it had some tlc.

Let me add this hotel is so safe covid wise. ALL staff wear masks, hand sanitizer is throughout the whole hotel, 2 metre signs all around, you could not go on the hotel bus without a mask not touch aircon settings. Well done as they did amazing. 👏", August 2020, Travelled with family

The rooms are a decent size and were kept very clean by the cleaning staff in particular Effie and the other lady. Breakfast was good with a good selection of hot and cold and the restaurant staff were friendly and the tables were cleared quickly. Didn’t eat in the evening so cannot comment on this. The only small negative is that the bar closes at 11pm so on return from an evening out nowhere to have a nightcap.

The pool area was lovely and never had a problem with sun beds and the pool bar served snacks at lunchtime which were lovely and not expensive.

The room was kept very clean, by the time you had been for breakfast it had been done, Again on the downside, anyone with a mobility problem - this is not the hotel for you !!
The staff were just wonderful - always a smile on their faces, and very helpful - the Reception was marvellous, and the Dinning Room - George the waiter was lovely, very helpful, the food was good too, quite a selection.
The only problem I had was with the barman in the evening - he would play his Heavy Metal music so loud (nothing wrong with that in the right place ) that you couldn't talk - the receptionist asked him twice to turn it down, and with his arrogance he completely ignored her !! so I went and asked him to turn it down, and he was very confrontational, so I said that I would report him to his manager !! even the receptionist was upset, and came out to apologise, all in all - completely unnecessary, he even kept the lights off so we were sitting in the dark !! not good.
There was a courtesy bus into the town, but it stopped quite early, so if you wanted to go into Skala at night, you had to get a taxi if you hadn't hired a car. The beach was down a steep flight of steps and pebbled. I think that management should think about perhaps putting entertainment on in the evenings as there is plenty of scope to do so. Would I go back to this particular hotel - I'm afraid the answer would have to be No. Which is a shame as the staff - with one exception really made the holiday go smoothly for us.", September 2019,

Expecting it to be quiet in September. On the contrary it was extremely busy and the car park full of hire cars.
Staff were kind and courteous, you only had to ask.
The upgrade to the room we had was really good and amazing views.
A real downside to this hotel has always been the bar, with no barman present. It is not an inviting space, housed in the reception area.
Breakfast at times was disappointing, and seemed to be running low on stock; bananas only available once weekly. However, lots of tempting sweet choices also available.
The Kefalonia cat situation is well known and distressingly at this hotel they have more than their share of malnourished kittens and cats. Some with severe eye infections which is a sad situation.
The room tax was quite expensive at €42 for the fortnight.

I had such a poor experience staying here and it's a shame since it was my first holidays with my girlfriend's family and we even got engaged there actually! Thankfully not in the hotel itself.

Let's start from the beginning actually. When we arrived there we had no idea what's going on. No one explained us anything, we didn't know a single thing about breakfast, lunch or dinner, but okay I get let this slide since we could find that information in our bedroom and at a notice board in the hotel.

Okay, let's continue. When we arrived into our room, we kind of a knew what to expect and were quite surprised that such an average room can be a part of four star hotel, but what shocked us was the air conditioner which when we turned it on started leaking heavily and almost flooded the room itself. To he fair, it was fixed quickly, but it shouldn't have happened in the first place. Other than that, we can't really complain about our room, but it's definitely not worthy four stars.

Let's move to the pool. It's a nice one, and I really loved it, nothing bad about the pool itself. However, the staff at the pool bar. Not professional, couldn't look more unhappy to be there. Everytime I had to ask for a drink, it would seem like I am asking them for a blood sample. I don't expect them to be all smiley all the time, but put an effort a little bit.

Next, lunch. Ufff. Dear me. Don't order potato salad because you will wait for it for two hours. Not joking! We have been waiting for two hours and it happenned twice in seven days. If you order burger, sure, you will get it straight away, but potato salad hell no. I don't know what happened there. And we asked about it we just got unpolite answer: 'It's going to come'. When? No one knew.

Te dinner itself was fine. Personally, it was a big choice and quite tasty. But again the same staff from pool bar was present there and it made it worse. We have been told that we have to wait five minutes for feta cheese because it was no longer at the buffet, however 15 minutes later we have been told that they ran out of it completely. Eh?! Ridiculous!

There is also a night bar which is located in the hotel. Again, same guy from the pool bar. His response on our excitement of being engaged and asking him if he has a champagne was not even congratulations (to be fair he doesn't have to be happy, it's just good customer service): 'What? What? Champagne? I don't have that'. Yelling at us like we did something wrong.

Overall experience was quite poor, and I have no idea how they have four stars. It's just shocking. Kefalonia itself is beautiful, but please choose a different hotel. We are sure we are not going back there ever again. And yeah, if you have any dietary requirements, forget about them. It's not really clear what has gluten, or nuts or anything else. If you ask the staff, I am sure they don't know themselves because to be fair they don't sound sure at all. Plus, their wifi is non existant. They shouldn't even advertise it.

There are some nice people there as well and I would like to thank them for their hospitality. Unfortunately I don't know their names, but the chef was super nice, Efi, a waiter always a friendly attitude and the guy who would tell us about deserts and special meals of the day during dinner.

The people who work their butts off to please holiday makers are a dream team 😇 they made our stay worth while and are real sweethearts.
First impression we were greeted by a bubbly smiling lovely lady named Irini
She was wonderful and works day and night with a smile on her face to keep the resort clean and tidy, and my children adored seeing her each day throughout our visit.
Room was always fresh and clean throughout our stay and the view was stunning of the ocean.
Pools were adequate never over crowded and always free sunbeds so no rush in the mornings(possibly due to less people because of covid?)
Bar staff makis and vaggelis were cheeky chaps and always service with a smile. Special mention to George who never failed to please and was always very fun and happy to talk and laugh with us, nothing was ever too much and it was always service with a smile from this lovely man.
Christos the gentleman who sees us in to the food hall was always smiling and very polite and happy to see us.
The animation team WOW!! Ewa the young lady on kids club is just something special, she smiles and smiles some more the kids adore her and her fun activities, she always goes the extra mile to keep the kids entertained day and night.
Klaudia full of energy and enthusiasm ALL the time! Shes crazy energetic and always does has a smile on her face.
Andrei what a breath of fresh air a man who truly loves his job and is eager to please a fantastic people person and again Smiley cheeky chap.
Our biggest con the food...
We are not fussy eaters and always happy to give any food a try but wow the salt. It's all very very salty and was warm at best the queue for breakfast was ridiculous we understand given covid that people cant be placed near eachother, but even when being asked to book a table we had to wait 45min because they wouldnt enforce table bookings and so most didnt bother. Bar snacks pahaa!!! Ok so bar snacks consist of biscuit or cake.... no sandwich or crisp or even chips ... just plain Madeira or biscuits...
Coffee is good and soft drinks are good.
Front of house day reception staff arent great and often come across rude and abrasive but night gentleman was sweet and helpful.
Only by being here for a fortnight did we discover what was included and what wasnt so a nice list would be good the cocktails on all inclusive are tasty but we did not know we were allowed them until one week in. Toilet area near pool often floods out and the drainage could do with being better as it does flood and gets very wet under foot I'll add this is due to wet guests not the actual toilet water but still gets kind of slippy and gross which only good drainage could tackle and solve.
Due to covid coffee making facilities have been removed from rooms but are available on request. Also the free shuttle bus is not running again due to covid.", August 2020, Travelled with family

Pools - 3 very small, over chlorinated, over crowded pools; can buy towels

Water park - may be it has been good 10 years ago but now it looks shabby and derailed. 5 short slides and the event of the day is the spraying water features they turn on at 12PM for 10min, whilst they keep the children away from them in case God forbid they get broken.

Food - canteen quality, very crowded restaurant!, no clean tables most of the times;

Drinks - horrible quality and you need to queue for every single glass as not more than 1 drink per person is allowed and they serve the drinks (even water and soft ones) in 100ml glasses.

All inclusive - nothing like it! we had to pay even for cold type of coffee! not to mention the alcohol drinks

Very disappointed, even the management is not decent - they told me that they had their 4 stars on technicality - number of pools; sq.footage of the room, etc.- rather than for the quality of the services they offer!

Arrived at the hotel around 10pm and as we where all inclusive once we had taken our bags to the room (Helped by staff members) we where taken to the restraunt to have our food which they had set aside for us. Nice touch!

The room we had was 534. Room was pretty basic but clean the maid was in daily tidying up the room and doing whatever needed to be done. Had a couple of problems with the room when we arrived we didn’t have a tv remote so couldn’t use the tv, took a couple of days to eventually get a remote but we where not all that fussed as the tv was just for the baby so sit and fall asleep to. One night the a/c started making funny noises so I had video’d it on my phone and took it to reception. Once they had saw this they called maintenance right away. It was fixed within an hour.

POOLS - there are 3 pools at the hotel, 2 big Pools and a baby pool. Plenty of sun loungers around so you’ll be able to find somewhere that suits you to relax

Food - breakfast was the only meal time we didn’t really enjoy the food just wasn’t for us. I mean we still had something but we did not like a lot of the food. Lunch & dinner time totally fine we always managed to find something to eat and something different. People reviewing the food as terrible need to have a look at themselves there is nothing wrong with it!

We visited as a family of 4 - had 2 rooms next to each other. Rooms were behind the reception and were the only rooms that had keys instead of a card to unlock - not a problem. . . Room wasn’t clean. First thing that I have noticed was no light socket .... the bathroom was very dirty and dust was visible everywhere! Toilet bin was full and last bit of toilet roll left... I find that disgusting. Only one wardrobe for me and my husband- I think that’s not enough. Only 4 hangers ?!! The bed seemed freshly made. The balcony was very small and next to a air conditioning unit from the kitchen - very noisy and the worst thing was that the extractor fans were next to it so we could smell everything! Burnt oil , meat , fish etc. Just horrible. We didn’t pay extra for any view but we were on ground floor and could see parking and back kitchen entrance for deliveries.... we thought our room was converted from an office... that’s about it if it comes to the room. The hotel it self seemed ok. Reception area was ok, pools very nice , bar pool needs a deep clean. The worst thing was the food - appealing ! It was a small hotel so there was not much choice... we liked the soups very much but that it. Most of the times food was warm or cold. Desserts - horrible ! One type of sweet for lunch and one type of sweet for dinner .... we were not happy with the food. Snacks at the bar : cold pizza, cold fries and cake (that cake was very nice).
The only good thing was that coffee machines were were available at reception , pool bar and the main restaurant so you could have a nice hot drink from it. Coffee , hot chocolate were very nice. That’s all for food and drinks.
Pool towels nice and clean, at reception you could swap it twice a day for a fresh one. No problem with the pool seats - there was always room. Very nice and quiet.
To the beach it was a 5 minutes walk. Very nice and quiet beach.

Overall would not come back to the hotel. Dirty and not nice food.", July 2018, Travelled with family

The first impression was not perfect, since power went out in Katelios upon our arrival. Hotel, of course, had nothing to do with it, but the first night we have spent in 30+ degrees since A/C was not working. The upside of the sea-view room was that we could spend the early morning on our terrace.

The room was rather clean, however, despite not having any food in the room, we met ants on the floor - twice. The bathroom was big and clean with one downside - we had a bathtub with hydromassage instead of a shower and the smell coming from the pipes was unbearable. Hotel service fixed it quite quickly though.

The terrace and view were outstanding and it is definitely worth it to pay extra for the sea-view if you have the chance.

The pool area is great, bar is close (great barmans!), lots of deckchairs, so we never had to worry about it. The animation team was also doing good job, trying to entertain us. Low amount of kids made the pool time very pleasant.

The food - mixed feelings for our entire group. Lunches and dinners were tasty, but breakfasts were so-so (repeatable and bland).

Staff is helpful - both at the reception and in the bar area. Room service could use some improvements (repeated requests not to leave the windows open did nothing).

Location makes the hotel rather calm. To get to the taverns and souvenir shops you have to walk 5-10min. The beach is close, but it is a poor one - narrow and rocky. To visit nice, sandy beaches you either have to walk 30min through seaside rocks or ride to other towns (Myrtos is a must!).

Concluding - as for Greek standards, the hotel is quite nice. You can find better ones but it all comes with higher price. The island on the other hand is fantastic, definitely rent a car/quad/bike and drive it through!", August 2017, Travelled with friends

Full body massage consisted of back, back of legs, shoulders, back of arms, NO front anything.
Although the massage was 'okay' we felt cheated as only half a body was done.
We mentioned our discontent at reception and was told we 'should have asked' for our front body to be done!!!! Very strange, if you book a facial does this mean you have to ask to have you're face done.

Room was big, clean and well equipped (beds were rather hard but I can't say that uncomfortable). Barthroom - well decorated with shower and bath. (You need to take your own cosmetics - shampoo, lotion, but there's a lot of soap ;)). Our room (210) was in very calm part of hotel. We had a sea-piece-view from the balcony but in fact we didn't spend too much time in room.
Restaurant is very good - popular food combined with traditional greek meals (absolutely amazing baklava!!!), service very kind.
Staff was friendly and helpful.
This place is in 90% Polish - main part of guests is here thanks to Grecos (travel agent); staff is greek and polish but all of them speak english fluently.
Highly recommended for whole families - because of calm, high culture, great animations and nice food.
Swimming pools are great with sweet water, with umbrellas and lounge beds. Bar is ready to serve between main meals.
You need to remember that this is not a hotel but resort so many of previous complaints about standard comparing to stars is unreasonable.
For Grecos guests - try to avoid resident's help - car rental or trip will be cheaper!

I krótko po polsku - miejsce warte odwiedzenia dla osób ceniących spokój, przyjazną atmosferę. Utopia nie jest typowo greckim miejscem - jest bardziej środkowo- europejska, ale dla nas akurat to zaleta. Nie ma tu imprez, więc jeśli ktoś oczekuje zabawy do białego rana w opcji all-inclusive, na pewno będzie rozczarowany. Duże brawa także dla animatorów za kawał bardzo dobrej roboty. Można tu spędzić naprawdę aktywny tydzień! Warto zabrać swoje kosmetyki, materac do pływania;) ale nie trzeba zabierać ręczników - zarówno te w pokoju jak i plażowo - basenowe zapewnia Utopia.

5 - Our room had an amazing view of the whole bay and mountains. The view from the pool area is also great and the pool is exceptionally clean and well maintained. Pool bar staff lovely. Plenty of sun loungers. Hotel only 5/10 minute walk from resort centre. Hotel grounds are beautiful and hotel is freshly painted and looks modern. Really happy with our room which had a great shower and comfy bed. Free air con.

3/4 - the breakfast was decent for a continental but could have made slight improvements. The hot food was cold and the air con unit blew out air right above the fresh watermelon tray which doesn’t seem hygienic. The quality overall of the food was good the Greek yoghurt was amazing and the homemade jams.

The cleanliness could have also been better, our room was not properly cleaned on arrival, there were marks on the floor with bits of hair. Our balcony wasn’t cleaned either throughout our whole stay. Also as the water mineral content of the tap water is so high it stained the glasses and cutlery, this is understandable but the cutlery wasn’t wiped so it was hard to tell of it was the water stains or dirty.

Hotel is situated in a elevated position with great views of the harbour, a 5-10 minute stroll from the centre of Lixouri.
Rooms were clean with air con, safe and a fridge at no extra cost which in other Greek resorts you usually have to pay for. Breakfast was okay, continental style which was constantly being replenished. Lovely Greek yoghurt.
Good pool area with plenty of sunbeds. You don't have to get up early to reserve beds, even after lunch. The pool is very deep, although there is a small children's pool with is under shade.Shame about the wasps which were constantly around the pool. The pool bar and food prices are very reasonable. The portion sizes were good.
We walked to Lepeda beach which was a 35 minute walk, 2 sunbeds and umbrella was 5 euros, great for snorkelling.
There was a smaller beach which was situated a 10 minute walk from the hotel by the Summery Hotel. We found this beach was quiet, and again sunbeds were 5 euros. You could walk out in the sea a fair distance and it was still only up to your waist- ideal for children.
Ferries over to Argostolli were frequent, 2.80 euros each, each way. We went over before 11am to see the giant turtles by the fishing boats (turn left off the ferry) which were lovely to see.
Lixouri is a delightful, typically Greek, family orientated town. We spent most of our evenings sitting in the main square watching the world go by.
If you are happy driving on the right, then hire a car. We hired a small car which was arranged by our TUI rep at a cost of 130 euros for 3 days, everything included in the price. Most of the roads are fine, just look out for the fallen rocks on the road when away from the main resorts! We visited Fiskardo, Assos, Agia Efimia, Sami, Myrtos Beach,Antisamos beach, Petani beach and Mellisana Lake.
If you need to fill up with petrol then you stay in your car. They come out and do this for you.
The only negative about the hotel was we had a later flight and we were unable to keep our room. We didn't want to waste our last day so after a day by the pool we asked if we could use their shower room. This was situated in the basement area and it was very dated, dirty with no hairdryer to use.

Although no beach the hotel offers a mini bus transfer to Lepeda beach, however we took the comfy cheap coach from the town center to nearby Xi beach around 12 mins away, the beach is a red sandy beach & lots of small restaurants on the beach front.
We popped over to Argostoli a few times a cheap 20 min boat transfer, boats were plentiful & run around every 10-15 mins during the busy season.
Whilst in Kefalonia we did the Premier Tui excursion, whilst a bit expensive we got to see some fantastic sights & scenery of Kefalonia, gorgeous little fishing villages of Sami, Agia Efimia, beautiful Assos, a mini cruise to FisKardo with a swim stop on the way, Melissani lake cavern, cake & coffee stop & a three course lunch so well worth the money.

Cleanliness could not be faulted and towels/bedding changed every other day. The breakfast was plentiful and consisted of fruit juice, the usual sliced cheese, meat, hard boiled eggs, fresh breads, butter, preserves, amazing Greek yoghurt and honey.

We moved rooms after the first night as we preferred a room at the front so moved from room 20 to 44 on the top floor - I seem to have mislaid a ring of sentimental value during the move and the girls looked for it for me in the previous room and Theo said he would continue to look and send it on - again going that extra mile to help really makes a difference.

Would highly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to chill in Fiscardo, the location is perfect- just outside of town and an easy walk in (and a complimentary shuttle has back!).

We stayed in a junior suite (107) which has fantastic views of Ithaca and the most amazing sunrise. Room is very spacious and bed comfy!

Breakfast at the Almyra is simple yet tasty. Fruit, yoghurt and honey was our regular choice. Homemade cakes, hot eggs (the oven baked omelette was my favourite), the Almyra's take on a spring roll has to be tried!

The hotel does not serve an evening meal, but there are plenty of restaurants down in the town. The lunch is great, lots of choice and an ideal way to while away a couple of hours in the day.

This hotel sees a lot of regulars and it has a lovely homely vibe. You can see why we all keep coming back.

The staff at the Almyra are all wonderful, but the star of the show is the wonderful Elani.

We arrived in the aftermath of the storm Ionis. The hotel had limited power and no hot water. Elani handled the whole situation calmly and efficiently - a good person to have around in a time of crisis!

We will see you again next year Elani! Thanks for being you.

The space was cold and dark which was perfect after a hot day on the beach and we slept so well!
The hotel is quiet and so peaceful. And a 2 minute stroll from the fantastic Avithos beach. On the beach there’s a great beach bar with a laid back vibe, sun beds you can hire for 8 euro a day for 2. And above the beach are 2 great tavernas specialising in fresh fish - we ate in the top one - our favourite by far.
It was great to return every evening to the pool to hang out with friends we’d made during our stay - a mix of English, Italians and Dutch.
The breakfast was good.
The only thing that could be improved ( hence why I’ve given it 4 stars and not 5) was the service at breakfast and the bar - it felt like the 2 waiters were a little overwhelmed at breakfast time and clearing tables didn’t happen as quickly as could. It would also be nice to have some comfier seating areas outside to kick back in and have a cocktail in the evening.

We visited during the Coronavirus period and didn’t know really what to expect. Got to the hotel mid afternoon just in time to get a bite to eat - all very English, chips with everything, and was told no restaurant in the evening due to low occupancy , only about 40% to normal. Still they provide a free taxi at 11, 2pm 4pm 7 and 8pm with pick ups at the same time as drop off down to Skala village about 3km away (you wouldn’t want to walk it). Staff (Mr Costas and family) are lovely and helpful and practiced social distancing and face covering meticulously, probably why so low level of virus in Greece. Room was clean but no way 4 star. We were self catering but little in the way of utensils which made cooking difficult. Only had 2 electric rings a microwave fridge and sink but made the best of it. The air conditioning was set to 16 degrees and made a bit of a racket but gave some relief from the daytime temperatures. Bar drinks were average price for the area with a good selection of spirits etc willingly served by Demetrius. Breakfast was varied from fried eggs to water melon all served with a smile by a very hard working Maikis.
I think we were lucky to come high season but have low season crowds this made restaurants easy to get in as tables always available. If you come here only have the little fish as bigger varieties are frozen imported, most restaurants do sardines and anchovies which are delicious. The town is great, no one being sick no clubs no pushy PAs but yet young old and middle aged mix well. Water is crystal clear, but little in the way of underwater life just like most of the Mediterranean, just take a trip to Zante from Porus sit back and enjoy the ride - well worth the 40euro.
All in all a great relaxing holiday surprisingly and would come back again", August 2020, Travelled with family

Check in easy very straightforward. Tax was €3 per room per night. Paid at the end of our stay.
A friendly, welcoming hotel that sits just outside Skala up on an incline with beautiful views over the coast. We sat and enjoyed breakfast overlooking the sea...so relaxing almost mesmerising. Just as enchanting by night.
The room was nice. Clean and tidy. Not de lux as we'd booked and expected but didn't feel that needed addressing. Fridge in the room to use.
Kettle inc tea/coffee making facilities.
No English tv but not an issue for us. Good wifi signal.
Pool is lovely and not overly busy. Towel provision so no need for beach towels.
Poolside bar.
Restaurant serves proper greek cuisine. We only ate there one evening as we like trying local restaurants but the food was excellent. I'd have def tried more on their menu but 4 night didn't allow.
We walked into Skala once which took about 50 mins. I like to get my bearings on arrival. The hotel provide a bus daily that takes you into Skala and returns. We informed reception of our 2pm pick up but after a no show we called the hotel and were picked up by car instead. There'd been a minor mishap their end.

The photographs of the bedrooms on their website are very deceiving.
Our room which was very basic and I have to say I was not in the least bit impressed by Nana who made no attempt to check if we could change our room to something a bit bigger and that offered proper storage for clothes. We ended up having to pile our clothes on the top of a desk.
The waiting staff were friendly and attentive .The hotel was clean, it has a nice pool, nice grounds and the balconies are covered with flowers.I found the hotel food average and luckily found a very good restaurant near by which offered excellent beautifully cooked traditional Greek dishes.
The nearby beach is small but the sea is beautiful to swim in.
On our departure date we were told by Nana that no rooms were available for us to get changed and freshen up in before we departed to the airport for our evening flight. We were told we could get a shower at the pool and then get changed in the pool toilets. By the time we were due to leave the outside shower was cold and the toilet floor wet and dirty.

The hotel staff are very accommodating, they even rushed out to the shops to get me soya milk for the whole of my stay , which was so lovely of them. Our room was on the second floor where you get a beautiful view of the bay and surrounding trees. There is a tiny ‘beach ‘ at the bottom of the hotel which we used for a quick swim in the mornings. However if you climb up the very steep hill you’ll find an amazing little secluded beach tucked underneath the cliffs. It’s a hike, but well worth it and brilliant for snorkelling The hotel arranged for us to hire a car as there’s nothing much going on around the hotel. We found incredible beaches, harbour villages and even saw turtles and thoroughly enjoyed exploring the island, it’s a must. There are a two restaurants by the hotel which are both okay however the food at Panas hotel was far superior. The breakfast wasn’t up to much, just a small selection of bread, scrambled eggs, one type of cereal and yogurt, but it was totally adequate.

I can confirm that if you want peace, quiet, beautiful beaches, clear blue sea , friendly staff, super clean room, home cooked beautiful food then this is the place.
It was opened in 1990 by nanas ( the lovely lady who everyone mentions who runs the place) parents even though 1990 the hotel has a 70s feel about it which we loved. Rustic cosy rooms, rustic wet rooms as the bathroom, clean towels and bedding daily, beautiful sea view with cascading flowers from every balcony.only used the pool a few times,we prefer the beach but it was immaculate and enough loungers for all.
A 2 min walk down a few steps onto the most beautiful sandy beach, clear blue sea, breath taking views surrounding you , the sand is level going out to sea so easy to enter and exit. Fab for snorkelling
There is also another little gem of a beach 5 mins up a steep road ( not good if struggle with breathing) past the fish restaurant Isola, Some days only me and my hubby was on it. Need sand shoes for this one
Food, there is limited choice in this area,there is only the hotel and 2 other restaurants within a 5 min walk, for others you will need a car but we found that for 7 nights we had enough choice as all the menus varied, not expensive in fact very reasonable. The hotel food was amazing, all home made.You sit under a terrace looking out to sea. Stunning. Average cost 2 course and wine €40
You then have the water ways bar/ restaurant opposite the hotel, a little more modern, fab cocktails and okay food, Another restaurant 5 min up the road, Isola sea food restaurant. I have also popped a review on this place.
We also hired a car for 3 days, would really recommend, Nana also arranges this for you. The cars range from €109 to €186 for 3 days dependant on size of car. Worth taking the extra €6 a day fully comp insurance too. we will definitely return for another restful, peaceful, delicious food/drink, stunning views island and this homely, friendly super clean hotel.

The rooms first - basic rooms but clean and includes aircon (something many hotels charge extra for). Also a mini fridge, hairdryer, decent shower. Our room was cleaned daily and it was always nice to come back to.

The restaurant - the restaurant serves food all day - and is traditional home cooked Greek food. We ate lunch there a couple of times and lunch also, but we preferred to go out and try different places. The cocktails are really nice!! We weren’t massively keen on the breakfast. It was fairly basic and for €7 per person you can get a much nicer breakfast elsewhere (I recommend Muses Cafe Bar which is about 9 miles away and a short car trip.

The pool - nice pool area although quite far from the bar for us lazy folk! Nice spot though and again, a nice clean area.

The staff - Nanna and the other staff were absolutely fab. We only had one small issue with being told off like naughty children for feeding the cats by the tall slim waiter. I understand that not everyone likes cats - but as animal lovers it is hard to ignore them and there are friendlier ways to be asked not to feed them.

This place just gets better and better and better with mine hosts Niko, Sofia and all of the team doing all they can to make your stay memorable. If you want to explore the beautiful island it is best to hire a car which can be arranged at the reception. If you want to just chill out then everything you need is at the hotel from the buffet breakfast (included), snacks at the pool bar or a meal in the evening. Food and drink prices are very reasonable. There are two beaches within walking distance of the hotel but the walk back is a bit steep. The hotel is also wheelchair and disabled friendly and the TBH team are only too willing to assist if needed. In my opinion this is the best hotel on the island and if you visit you will not be disappointed. The bonus for me is that this is an adult only hotel.", August 2019,

We celebrated our 35th wedding anniversary and was recommended to this hotel. To say we were spoilt on our anniversary day is an understatement. The hotel is full of repeat customers, some who have been coming for 20 years since it opened, which is a statement in itself and we will certainly come back again. So thanks Nico, Sofia and your wonderful team. You made our anniversary very special. Derek and Julie Haigh.", August 2019, Travelled as a couple

I feel all the staff and especially the owners are now my friends. From the moment we arrived at the airport and were greeted with kisses and hugs until the day we left and were waved down the drive by Nico and his wife Sofia we were treated like family staying in their special family home.
All the staff were friendly, helpful and attentive nothing is too much trouble. The large terrace to enjoy breakfast and dinner with beautiful views out to sea and the pool area with it’s comfy sun beds and lovely pool are stand out features for me. It is quiet, relaxing and chilled - what more could you want !", July 2019, Travelled with friends
