# Webscraping
Here i scrape various websites using selenium,beautifulsoup
Here i test with crawling from tripadvisor with the hotel links
At first pip install -r requirements.txt
It crawl more than 15 data from each links like hotel_name,address,covid type,customer,name address, comment etc 
Should replace the file detail in config.ini file and replace the chromedriver path for crawling and saving the data
after changing in the ini file then run the tripadvisor.py python file and check the data is saved as a .csv file.
